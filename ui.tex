\subsection{Graphical Interface Interaction}

		A graphical web interface was chosen as a solution to give users quick
		interaction with \TVB . The web interface is easy to access (locally or
		remotely) through a web browser, it can be used by different types of
		users, including those without programming knowledge, and it offers
		great support while learning about \TVB concepts and workflow
		expectations.  In our architecture diagrams, the actor accessing \TVB
		through the web interface is called a \emph{G-User}.

		The http is served using \emph{Cherrypy}
		\texttt{http://www.cherrypy.org/} which is a minimalist, object-
		oriented web framework,  in combination with \emph{Genshi} templating
		system, to support the separation of layers as guided by the 
		\emph{Model View Controller (MVC)} pattern.

		\subsubsection{Projects, Accounts, Operations \& Data}

		TVB uses entities like: Account, Project, Operation, DataType and
		Workflow, for modeling G-User actions and artifacts.

 \begin{figure}[!htbp]

		(D) DataType details and further available operations for it. This menu becomes available after clicking a DataType result from several places in \TVB }
				\label{fig:project}
\end{figure}

		An \emph{Account} or \emph{User} is needed for accessing \TVB through
		the web interface.  When \TVB web interface is fired for the first
		time, the G-User is requested to set their username and a
		password for the first account -- which acts under an
		\emph{administrator} role. After this, more users can \emph{register}
		for accounts, which then need to be validated by the admin
		account.

		A \emph{Project} in \TVB is a logical grouping entity, which  can be
		used in several ways by the end-user;  for example one could choose to
		create a project for each experiment in \TVB, while others might
		create projects for each subject of a group. Each project has a single
		\emph{User} (or \emph{Account}) as owner, but a project can be shared
		with multiple users to allow for collaborative research.

		Any execution of an Adapter results in an \emph{Operation} in the
		context of a project. Multiple operations will be executed under the
		same project. For example we will have operations created for each
		execution of a simulation, each run of a Fourier analyzer, or launch
		of a Brain Visualizer. An operation changes status over time, from
		\emph{started} into \emph{canceled}, \emph{finished successfully} or
		\emph{finished with error}. One operation can have multiple input and
		output parameters and parameters can be scalars or DataTypes.

		A \emph{Workflow} in \TVB is a set of operations with their artifacts,
		and wraps around a simulation as the leading component. A workflow can be
		seen as a default \emph{tag}, placed by the system on Operations and
		DataTypes  which are logically, sequentially, connected.
		Custom tags can also be added by the end-user both on DataTypes
		and Operations, for tracking entities inside a Project.

		\subsubsection{Simulator Interface}

		The \emph{Simulator} page is a presented as a configurable multicolumn interface that combines \TVB simulation, analysis and visualization functionalities (Fig.\ref{fig:simulator} A).

		\begin{figure}[!htbp]

		\centering
			\subfloat[][]{\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{images/ui_simulator.png}}

			\\
			\subfloat[][]{\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{images/ui_simulator_setup_region_noise.png}}
			\caption{\TVB Simulator Area: 
			(A) View of the main interface. Left, the history column keeps the information about the simulations and their status; middle, the simulation core column is where simulations are configured (e.g., change model, parameters, simulation length); and right, the visualization column, gives the possibility to configure visualizers to display the resulting time series or visualizers that will add an analysis step before displaying the results.  
			(B) Region-based simulation configuration area. The parameters of the local model can be set independently for each node, that is, the dynamics of each node may be different. 
			(C) Surface-based simulation configuration area. In a similar fashion, the model parameters are \emph{spatialized} by defining them as a function of a certain kernel (e.g., Gaussian kernel).
			(D) Noise configuration area. }
		\label{fig:simulator}
		\end{figure}

		On the left column, a history of all simulations is kept and can be 
		accessed at any time. Each simulation can be renamed or deleted.

		The middle column of the \emph{Simulator} area is where users configure their
		large-scale brain network model. On the top of this column there is a blank
		field to name each particular configuration and a button to launch simulations.
		Via this column, users have access to all the configurable components that might
		be used in a simulation, namely:

		{\small

		\begin{itemize}
			\item long range connectivity (i.e., the connectome or connectivity matrix);
			\item long range coupling function (to scale the weights in the connectivity matrix);
			\item conduction speed;
			\item cortical surface;
			\begin{itemize}
				\item local connectivity kernel;
				\item local connectivity strength (can be configured to be different for each vertex);
				\item region mapping (correspondences between vertices of the surface and anatomical regions in the connectome);
			\end{itemize}
			\item stimulus
			\item local dynamics model (i.e. neural mass model)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item state variable range;
					\item state variables to be recorded and stored;
					\item initial conditions (seed and type of noise used to set random initial conditions);
				\end{itemize}
			\item integration scheme;
			\begin{itemize}
				\item if stochastic, the seed for numpy's rand can be set as well as the type of noise (white, coloured);
				\item integration time step size;
			\item monitors (you can set the monitors period to downsample the raw time-series)
			\item simulation length
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		}

 \note[psl] Explain continuation feature.  

		Additional information about the components (e.g., modules, datatypes
		and their attributes) is available  by clicking on the interrogation
		mark icon next to each element. This documentation is pulled from the
		annotations provided by the traits system and doc strings.

		Specific pages are accessible for setting up the neural mass model
		parameters in region-based and surface-based simulations, as well as
		for configuring the noise amplitude in stochastic integrations (only
		for region-based simulations) (Figs. \ref{fig:simulator} B, C and D)
		The `Set up region Model` area consist of an interactive phase-plane
		display. This tool shows the 2-dimensional planes of the general
		n-dimensional phase space of the local dynamic model. This tool is
		used to observe how the dynamics of the physical model change as a
		function of its parameters, acting as a guide to set those parameters
		appropriately.

		For surface-based simulations the model parameters are defined as
		a function of distance from a central focal point (vertex of the
		surface). Thus, there is an extra layer of complexity by spatially
		varying the model parameters.

		On the right column, different displays can be configured to exhibit
		the simulated time series or to add an analysis step and see those
		results (e.g., compute the correlation coefficients and visualize the
		resulting matrix).

		It is possible to launch parallel simulations to systematically explore a set of
		components (e.g., a parameter of the  the local dynamics model, coupling
		strength, conduction speed, among others. The resulting maps will be presented
		either in a discrete (Fig.\ref{fig:visualizers} A) or a continuous 2D plot. 

		\note[psl]{Maybe mention that the value presented in the pse images is
		a float representing a certain charactersitic of a time-series
		collection (eg, for exploring synchronization one should use the
		kuramoto index parameter.)}

		
		\subsubsection{Analysis \& Visualizers}

			\TVB does not aim to compete at the analysis level with other tools in
			Neuroscience that are highly specialized and with great history in data
			analysis, like FSL \cite{Smith_2004, Woolrich_2009, Jenkinson_2012} ,
			SPM \cite{Friston_1995}, FieldTrip \cite{Oostenveld_2011} and
			Brainstorm \cite{Tadel_2011}.  What we offer is a minimalist set of
			algorithms to post-process your simulated results (or even process
			imported patient measured scans) inside \TVB, mainly for quick
			validations.

			Included in \TVB are adapters for \emph{Fast ICA} from the
			python library \emph{sklearn}, a python implementation of
			\emph{Fourier Spectral Analysis}, the, Matlab based, Brain 
			Connectivity Toolbox \emph{BCT}  
			\url{https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/}, as
			well as a range of other analyzers.

			For each of the DataTypes produced in \TVB, one or more
			visualizers are available. \TVB has a number of visualizer types,
			each developed with the technology that provides the best support 
			for the specific requirements of a given visualization:

			 \begin{figure}[!htbp]

				\label{fig:visualizers}
			\end{figure}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \emph{WebGL viewers:} are based on \emph{HTML 5 Canvas} element
		and the \emph{gl} context. These viewers offer nice 3D display,
		vectorial zoom support, user interaction with the scene (rotate,
		translate), quick response (even when thousands of vertices and edges
		are to be manipulated) and good resolution for exported images.
		
		\item \emph{SVG viewers:} offer great selection, zoom and scaling
		effects and extraordinary quality for exported images, while
		having a relatively low number of elements to display on the page. We
		use such viewers for manipulating and displaying TimeSeries,
		Covariance or Cross Coherence DataType results. These visualizers
		were developed expressly for these data types in TVB, and provide a 
		richer level of interaction than Canvas based visualizers.

		\item \emph{MPLH5 viewers:}  emph{Matplotlib} has an \emph{HTML 5}
		backend that we use for viewing some of \TVB's DataTypes (like
		Fourier or Wavelet) \url{https://code.google.com/p/mplh5canvas/}

		\item \emph{Other} simpler viewers in \TVB are using JIT
		\url{http://philogb.github.io/jit/} or FLOT
		\url{http://www.flotcharts.org/} - JS libraries. These are mainly
		2D graph displayers for some simple \TVB generated data.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Connectivity Tools}

		\emph{Connectivity} in the context of \TVB is a DataType, mapping structural
		information about a subject (a real single individual or an average template). For
		editing and viewing a Connectivity, \TVB has a specific page, where
		the \emph{G-User} can manipulate connectivity strength and lengths
		starting from the granularity of an edge.

		We do not store or use information about the exact anatomical path or
		a connection, only the region centers and connection weights and
		lengths.

		(B) Left side: Show effect of connectivity delays (in milliseconds) when conduction speed is 1 mm/ms.
		Right side: Editing and displaying one quadrant from the matrix of connection tracts.}
				\label{fig:connectivity}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Stimulus Editor}

	In the \emph{Stimulus} area, an interactive environment assists users to
	generate stimulation patterns (e.g., a modeling study about TMS) that maybe be
	later included in a simulation. Similarly to the mechanism employed to vary
	model parameters from node to node, stimulation patterns are generated
	independently for region-based and surface-based simulations. In the former, a
	unique temporal profile can be specified for each node, although the amplitude
	of the stimulation can be modulated individually for each node. In the latter,
	in addition to the temporal profile, it is possible to select several vertices
	on the surface to define the foci around which a spatial pattern is centered
	(Fig. \ref{fig:stimulus}). A stimulation profile in \TVB is a Pattern
	datatype, and it can be either temporal or spatiotemporal depending the
	spatial support of the network.

\subsection{Console and scripting interface}

\note[lp]{How does it work?}

\subsubsection{Python Scripting}

The components of TVB are of course accessible from a Python
script or, more conveniently, from any of the IPython interfaces.
For example, the tutorials for the simulator have been developed
as IPython notebooks, due to its ability to mix text, mathematics,
code and figures. 

\texttt{hello\_brain.py}
To give a basic feel for scripting TVB simulations, we will 
walk through a simple example of a region-level simulation shown in
Code~\ref{lst:uipython}

\lstinputlisting[caption={Python Listing},label={lst:uipython}]{python_lst.py}

\note[sk]{with inputing the code like this the listing is now disjoint from the
associated text, one or the other needs to be modified}

%\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Python Listing},label={lst:py1}]
%from tvb.simulator.lab import *
%\end{lstlisting}

\noindent which is an all-in-one module making writing scripts
shorter, in the style of \texttt{pylab}, as it imports everything
from \texttt{pylab}, \texttt{numpy} and most of TVB's simulator
modules. Next, we build a simulator object:

%<<<<<<< HEAD
%\begin{lstlisting}
%sim = simulator.Simulator(
%		model        = models.Generic2dOscillator(), 
%		connectivity = connectivity.Connectivity(),
%		coupling     = coupling.Linear(a=1e-2),
%		integrator   = integrators.HeunDeterministic(),
%		monitors     = (
%				monitors.TemporalAverage(), 
%		)
%)
%\end{lstlisting}
%=======
%\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Python Listing},
%                   label={lst:py2}]
%sim = simulator.Simulator(
%    model        = models.Generic2dOscillator(), 
%    connectivity = connectivity.Connectivity(),
%    coupling     = coupling.Linear(a=1e-2),
%    integrator   = integrators.HeunDeterministic(),
%    monitors     = (
%        monitors.TemporalAverage(), 
%    )
%)
%\end{lstlisting}
%>>>>>>> lp

\noindent where we've employed a two dimensional oscillator
with default parameters, the default connectivity, a linear 
coupling function with a slope of $1e-2$, and deterministic
Heun integrator and a monitor that temporally averages the 
network dynamics before providing output.

While TVB strives to keep modules independent of one another,
it is typical for mathematical dependencies to arise between, 
for example, the mass model and the integration time step, so
after configuring a simulator object, it is necessary to invoke

%\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Python Listing},label={lst:py3}]
%sim.configure()
%\end{lstlisting}

which results in walking the tree of objects, checking and 
configuring the constraints among parameters recursively.

The next step is to run through the simulation, collecting
output from the simulator. In this case, it is as simple as
%<<<<<<< HEAD
%\begin{lstlisting}
%ys = array([y for ((t, y),) 
%					in  sim(simulation_length=3e2)])
%\end{lstlisting}
%=======
%\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Python Listing},label={lst:py4}]
%ys = array([y for ((t, y),) 
%	      in  sim(simulation_length=3e2)])
%\end{lstlisting}
%>>>>>>> lp

\noindent where the simulator has been called, returning a 
generator which performs the integration and returns, for each
monitor, the current time and activity. In a case where EEG 
and fMRI monitors, for example, were used, we might write
%<<<<<<< HEAD
%\begin{lstlisting}
%eeg, mri = [], []
%for (t_eeg, y_eeg), (t_mri, y_mri) in sim(3e2):
%		if y_eeg is not None:
%		eeg.append(y_eeg)
%		...
%\end{lstlisting}
%=======
%\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Python Listing},label={lst:py5}]
%eeg, mri = [], []
%for (t_eeg, y_eeg), (t_mri, y_mri) in sim(3e2):
%    if y_eeg is not None:
%	eeg.append(y_eeg)
%    ...
%\end{lstlisting}
%>>>>>>> lp

\noindent Because fMRI and EEG monitors have very different
timescales, whenever one monitor return data and the others do
not, the others contain \texttt{None}, hence the check. Building
more complex logic in this loop would permit, for example, online
feedback and modification of connectivity. 

After the simulation loop has finished, you may wish to see the
result, following the previous listing, 
%\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Python Listing},label={lst:py6}]
%plot(ys[:, 0, :, 0], 'k', alpha=0.1)
%\end{lstlisting}
\noindent Here we note that \texttt{ys} is four dimensional. The 
simulator has the convention of treating  mass model state as a
three dimensional array of state variables by nodes by statistical
modes. Because \texttt{ys} is an array collected over time, the first
dimension is time, and the plot here is of each node's first state
variable, over time.

Many more demonstrations of the various features of the simulator
can been found in scripts distributed with the sources of TVB, or 
browsed online at \url{https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/scientific_library/tree/trunk/tvb/simulator/demos}.
