On going work on the simulator includes

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Code generation in the simulator to compile specifications to native
		code running independently of TVB or on the GPU.
	\item MATLAB interface
	\item Spatial derivatiaves (?) 
\end{enumerate}

As previously stated, the primary goal of the \TVB is to provide the means
to pass all the way from structural imaging data to dynamic imaging. We
aren't there yet, as several pieces still require scientific consensus 
and standards. Notably, 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item DTI pipeline
	\item Connectome Project
	\item Structural imaging processing via FreeSurfer (pySurfer, NiPy, etc.)
	\item NeuroML project	
\end{enumerate}


In the near future, our informatics efforts outside of these areas will
focus on making the platform accessible and demonstrating the validity
of the simulations with respect to empirical data.
