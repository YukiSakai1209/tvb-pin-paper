  title = {Critical fluctuations in cortical models near instability.},
  journal = {Front. Physiol.},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {3},
  pages = {331},
  abstract = {Computational studies often proceed from the premise that cortical
	dynamics operate in a linearly stable domain, where fluctuations
	dissipate quickly and show only short memory. Studies of human electroencephalography
	(EEG), however, have shown significant autocorrelation at time lags
	on the scale of minutes, indicating the need to consider regimes
	where non-linearities influence the dynamics. Statistical properties
	such as increased autocorrelation length, increased variance, power
	law scaling, and bistable switching have been suggested as generic
	indicators of the approach to bifurcation in non-linear dynamical
	systems. We study temporal fluctuations in a widely-employed computational
	model (the Jansen-Rit model) of cortical activity, examining the
	statistical signatures that accompany bifurcations. Approaching supercritical
	Hopf bifurcations through tuning of the background excitatory input,
	we find a dramatic increase in the autocorrelation length that depends
	sensitively on the direction in phase space of the input fluctuations
	and hence on which neuronal subpopulation is stochastically perturbed.
	Similar dependence on the input direction is found in the distribution
	of fluctuation size and duration, which show power law scaling that
	extends over four orders of magnitude at the Hopf bifurcation. We
	conjecture that the alignment in phase space between the input noise
	vector and the center manifold of the Hopf bifurcation is directly
	linked to these changes. These results are consistent with the possibility
	of statistical indicators of linear instability being detectable
	in real EEG time series. However, even in a simple cortical model,
	we find that these indicators may not necessarily be visible even
	when bifurcations are present because their expression can depend
	sensitively on the neuronal pathway of incoming fluctuations.},

	neuronal connectivity at either a macroscopic level (in long-distance
	pathways for the entire brain) or a microscopic level (among axons,
	dendrites, and synapses in a small brain region). The Neuroscience
	Information Framework (NIF) encompasses all of neuroscience and facilitates
	the integration of existing knowledge and databases of many types.

	A novel fitting method was used to determine peak parameters in the

	times the alpha peak frequency on an individual-subject basis. Moreover,

  abstract = {Parkinsonism leads to various electrophysiological changes in the
	basal ganglia-thalamocortical system (BGTCS), often including elevated
	discharge rates of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the output nuclei,
	and reduced activity of the globus pallidus external (GPe) segment.
	These rate changes have been explained qualitatively in terms of
	the direct/indirect pathway model, involving projections of distinct
	striatal populations to the output nuclei and GPe. Although these
	populations partly overlap, evidence suggests dopamine depletion
	differentially affects cortico-striato-pallidal connection strengths
	to the two pallidal segments. Dopamine loss may also decrease the
	striatal signal-to-noise ratio, reducing both corticostriatal coupling
	and striatal firing thresholds. Additionally, nigrostriatal degeneration
	may cause secondary changes including weakened lateral inhibition
	in the GPe, and mesocortical dopamine loss may decrease intracortical
	excitation and especially inhibition. Here a mean-field model of
	the BGTCS is presented with structure and parameter estimates closely
	based on physiology and anatomy. Changes in model rates due to the
	possible effects of dopamine loss listed above are compared with
	experiment. Our results suggest that a stronger indirect pathway,
	possibly combined with a weakened direct pathway, is compatible with
	empirical evidence. However, altered corticostriatal connection strengths
	are probably not solely responsible for substantially increased STN
	activity often found. A lower STN firing threshold, weaker intracortical
	inhibition, and stronger striato-GPe inhibition help explain the
	relatively large increase in STN rate. Reduced GPe-GPe inhibition
	and a lower GPe firing threshold can account for the comparatively
	small decrease in GPe rate frequently observed. Changes in cortex,
	GPe, and STN help normalize the cortical rate, also in accord with
	experiments. The model integrates the basal ganglia into a unified
	framework along with an existing thalamocortical model that already
	accounts for a wide range of electrophysiological phenomena. A companion
	paper discusses the dynamics and oscillations of this combined system.},

  abstract = {Functional interactions between different brain regions require connecting
	fiber tracts, the structural basis of the human connectome. To assemble
	a comprehensive structural understanding of neural network elements
	from the microscopic to the macroscopic dimensions, a multimodal
	and multiscale approach has to be envisaged. However, the integration
	of results from complementary neuroimaging techniques poses a particular
	challenge. In this paper, we describe a steadily evolving neuroimaging
	technique referred to as three-dimensional polarized light imaging
	(3D-PLI). It is based on the birefringence of the myelin sheaths
	surrounding axons, and enables the high-resolution analysis of myelinated
	axons constituting the fiber tracts. 3D-PLI provides the mapping
	of spatial fiber architecture in the postmortem human brain at a
	sub-millimeter resolution, i.e., at the mesoscale. The fundamental
	data structure gained by 3D-PLI is a comprehensive 3D vector field
	description of fibers and fiber tract orientations - the basis for
	subsequent tractography. To demonstrate how 3D-PLI can contribute
	to unravel and assemble the human connectome, a multiscale approach
	with the same technology was pursued. Two complementary state-of-the-art
	polarimeters providing different sampling grids (pixel sizes of 100

	this approach, fiber orientation maps and 3D fiber models were reconstructed

  abstract = {Natural phenomena are reducible to quantum events in principle, but
	quantum mechanics does not always provide the best level of analysis.
	The many-body problem, chaotic avalanches, materials properties,
	biological organisms, and weather systems are better addressed at
	higher levels. Animals are highly organized, goal-directed, adaptive,
	selectionist, information-preserving, functionally redundant, multicellular,
	quasi-autonomous, highly mobile, reproducing, dissipative systems
	that conserve many fundamental features over remarkably long periods
	of time at the species level. Animal brains consist of massive, layered
	networks of specialized signaling cells with 10,000 communication
	points per cell, and interacting up to 1000 Hz. Neurons begin to
	divide and differentiate very early in gestation, and continue to
	develop until middle age. Waking brains operate far from thermodynamic
	equilibrium under delicate homeostatic control, making them extremely
	sensitive to a range of physical and chemical stimuli, highly adaptive,
	and able to produce a remarkable range of goal-relevant actions.
	Consciousness is "a difference that makes a difference" at the level
	of massive neuronal interactions in the most parallel-interactive
	anatomical structure of the mammalian brain, the cortico-thalamic
	(C-T) system. Other brain structures are not established to result
	in direct conscious experiences, at least in humans. However, indirect
	extra-cortical influences on the C-T system are pervasive. Learning,
	brain plasticity and major life adaptations may require conscious
	cognition. While brains evolved over hundreds of millions of years,
	and individual brains grow over months, years and decades, conscious
	events appear to have a duty cycle of ∼100 ms, fading after a few
	seconds. They can of course be refreshed by inner rehearsal, re-visualization,
	or attending to recurrent stimulus sources. These very distinctive
	brain events are needed when animals seek out and cope with new,
	unpredictable and highly valued life events, such as evading predators,
	gathering critical information, seeking mates and hunting prey. Attentional
	selection of conscious events can be observed behaviorally in animals
	showing coordinated receptor orienting, flexible responding, alertness,
	emotional reactions, seeking, motivation and curiosity, as well as
	behavioral surprise and cortical and autonomic arousal. Brain events
	corresponding to attentional selection are prominent and widespread.
	Attention generally results in conscious experiences, which may be
	needed to recruit widespread processing resources in the brain. Many
	neuronal processes never become conscious, such as the balance system
	of the inner ear. An air traveler may "see" the passenger cabin tilt
	downward as the plane tilts to descend for a landing. That visual
	experience occurs even at night, when the traveler has no external
	frame of spatial reference. The passenger's body tilt with respect
	to gravity is detected unconsciously via the hair cells of the vestibular
	canals, which act as liquid accelerometers. However, that sensory
	activity is not experienced directly. It only becomes conscious via
	vision and the body senses. The vestibular sense is therefore quite
	different from visual perception, which "reports" accurately to a
	conscious field of experience, so that we can point accurately to
	a bright star on a dark night. Vestibular input is also precise but
	unconscious. Conscious cognition is therefore a distinct kind of
	brain event. Many of its features are well established, and must
	be accounted for by any adequate theory. No non-biological examples
	are known. Penrose and Hameroff have proposed that consciousness
	may be viewed as a fundamental problem in quantum physics. Specifically,
	their 'orchestrated objective reduction' (Orch-OR) hypothesis posits
	that conscious states arise from quantum computations in the microtubules
	of neurons. However, a number of microtubule-associated proteins
	are found in both plant and animal cells (like neurons) and plants
	are not generally considered to be conscious. Current quantum-level
	proposals do not explain the prominent empirical features of consciousness.
	Notably, they do not distinguish between closely matched conscious
	and unconscious brain events, as cognitive-biological theories must.
	About half of the human brain does not support conscious contents
	directly, yet neurons in these "unconscious" brain regions contain
	large numbers of microtubules. QM phenomena are famously observer-dependent,
	but to the best of our knowledge it has not been shown that they
	require a conscious observer, as opposed to a particle detector.
	Conscious humans cannot detect quantum events "as such" without the
	aid of special instrumentation. Instead, we categorize the wavelengths
	of light into conscious sensory events that neglect their quantum
	mechanical properties. In science the burden of proof is on the proposer,
	and this burden has not yet been met by quantum-level proposals.
	While in the future we may discover quantum effects that bear distinctively
	on conscious cognition 'as such,' we do not have such evidence today.},

  abstract = {We previously proposed an integrated electroencephalography (EEG),
	magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
	(fMRI) model based on an extended neural mass model (ENMM) within
	a single cortical area. In the ENMM, a cortical area contains several
	minicolumns where strengths of their connections diminish exponentially
	with their distances. The ENMM was derived based on the physiological
	principles of the cortical minicolumns and their connections within
	a single cortical area to generate EEG, MEG, and fMRI signals. The
	purpose of this paper is to further extend the ENMM model from a
	single-area to a multi-area model to develop a neural mass model
	of the entire brain that generates EEG and MEG signals. For multi-area
	modeling, two connection types are considered: short-range connections
	(SRCs) and long-range connections (LRCs). The intra-area SRCs among
	the minicolumns within the areas were previously modeled in the ENMM.
	To define inter-area LRCs among the cortical areas, we consider that
	the cell populations of all minicolumns in the destination area are
	affected by the excitatory afferent of the pyramidal cells of all
	minicolumns in the source area. The state-space representation of
	the multi-area model is derived considering the intra-minicolumn,
	SRCs', and LRCs' parameters. Using simulations, we evaluate effects
	of parameters of the model on its dynamics and, based on stability
	analysis, find valid ranges for parameters of the model. In addition,
	we evaluate reducing redundancy of the model parameters using simulation
	results and conclude that the parameters of the model can be limited
	to the LRCs and SRCs while the intra-minicolumn parameters stay at
	their physiological mean values. The proposed multi-area integrated
	E/MEG model provides an efficient neuroimaging technique for effective
	connectivity analysis in healthy subjects as well as neurological
	and psychiatric patients.},

	Weighted Imaging (DWI) is a challenging research topic that has recently
	gained a lot of attention. In the present work, we investigate the
	effects of intra-voxel fiber direction modeling and tractography
	algorithm on derived structural network indices (e.g. density, small-worldness
	and global efficiency). The investigation is centered on three semi-independent
	distinctions within the large set of available diffusion models and
	tractography methods: i) single fiber direction versus multiple directions
	in the intra-voxel diffusion model, ii) deterministic versus probabilistic
	tractography and iii) local versus global measure-of-fit of the reconstructed
	fiber trajectories. The effect of algorithm and parameter choice
	has two components. First, there is the large effect of tractography
	algorithm and parameters on global network density, which is known
	to strongly affect graph indices. Second, and more importantly, there
	are remaining effects on graph indices which range in the tens of
	percent even when global density is controlled for. This is crucial
	for the sensitivity of any human structural network study and for
	the validity of study comparisons. We then investigate the effect

	of the resulting connections with a connectome dissection quality
	control (QC) approach. In this approach, evaluation of Tract Specific

	information processing and storage. Previous work from our laboratory
	(Beggs and Plenz, 2003) revealed that propagation of local field
	potentials (LFPs) in cortical circuits could be described by the
	same equations that govern avalanches. Whereas modeling studies suggested
	that these "neuronal avalanches" were optimal for information transmission,
	it was not clear what role they could play in information storage.
	Work from numerous other laboratories has shown that cortical structures
	can generate reproducible spatiotemporal patterns of activity that
	could be used as a substrate for memory. Here, we show that although
	neuronal avalanches lasted only a few milliseconds, their spatiotemporal
	patterns were also stable and significantly repeatable even many
	hours later. To investigate these issues, we cultured coronal slices
	of rat cortex for 4 weeks on 60-channel microelectrode arrays and
	recorded spontaneous extracellular LFPs continuously for 10 hr. Using
	correlation-based clustering and a global contrast function, we found
	that each cortical culture spontaneously produced 4736 +/- 2769 (mean
	+/- SD) neuronal avalanches per hour that clustered into 30 +/- 14
	statistically significant families of spatiotemporal patterns. In
	10 hr of recording, over 98\% of the mutual information shared by
	these avalanche patterns were retained. Additionally, jittering analysis
	revealed that the correlations between avalanches were temporally
	precise to within +/-4 msec. The long-term stability, diversity,
	and temporal precision of these avalanches indicate that they fulfill
	many of the requirements expected of a substrate for memory and suggest
	that they play a central role in both information transmission and
	storage within cortical networks.},

  abstract = {Networks of living neurons exhibit diverse patterns of activity, including
	oscillations, synchrony, and waves. Recent work in physics has shown
	yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear
	units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes,
	and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical
	state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described
	by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with
	complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons.
	We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute
	slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials
	continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show
	that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is
	described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory
	for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law
	with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter
	close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching
	parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward
	networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings
	suggest that "neuronal avalanches" may be a generic property of cortical
	networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly
	from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the
	critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of
	information transmission and network stability.},

	Synchronous large-amplitude bursts (also called neuronal avalanches)

	scalp and intracranial EEG in the context of LRTC. Results indicate

	A mass of such cells, randomly placed together with a uniform volume

	The propagation of a plane wave of activity has been considered in
	some detail. It is shown that a wave may be initiated in a mass of
	such cells by a number of individual stimuli. The mass has a very
	sensitive threshold to such stimulation. This threshold depends on
	cell properties, and by altering the threshold a mass of cells may
	be made to act as an on/off switch. The switching of waves may be
	compared with the shifting of attention in a living organism. Particularly
	interesting phenomena emerge if some property of the individual cells,
	e.g. size, extent of axon or dendrite structure, or threshold, changes
	with repeated use. The mass of cells may then exhibit an ability
	to modify its response according to past experience in a manner similar
	to that of living organisms. Trial and error learning, conditioned

  abstract = {Non-invasive measuring methods such as EEG/MEG, fMRI and DTI are increasingly
	utilised to extract quantitative information on functional and anatomical
	connectivity in the human brain. These methods typically register
	their data in Euclidean space, so that one can refer to a particular
	activity pattern by specifying its spatial coordinates. Since each
	of these methods has limited resolution in either the time or spatial
	domain, incorporating additional data, such as those obtained from
	invasive animal studies, would be highly beneficial to link structure
	and function. Here we describe an approach to spatially register
	all cortical brain regions from the macaque structural connectivity
	database CoCoMac, which contains the combined tracing study results
	from 459 publications (http://cocomac.g-node.org). Brain regions
	from 9 different brain maps were directly mapped to a standard macaque
	cortex using the tool Caret (Van Essen and Dierker, 2007). The remaining
	regions in the CoCoMac database were semantically linked to these
	9 maps using previously developed algebraic and machine-learning
	techniques (Bezgin et al., 2008; Stephan et al., 2000). We analysed
	neural connectivity using several graph-theoretical measures to capture
	global properties of the derived network, and found that Markov Centrality
	provides the most direct link between structure and function. With
	this registration approach, users can query the CoCoMac database
	by specifying spatial coordinates. Availability of deformation tools
	and homology evidence then allow one to directly attribute detailed
	anatomical animal data to human experimental results.},

  abstract = {By modelling the average activity of large neuronal populations, continuum
	mean field models (MFMs) have become an increasingly important theoretical
	tool for understanding the emergent activity of cortical tissue.
	In order to be computationally tractable, long-range propagation
	of activity in MFMs is often approximated with partial differential
	equations (PDEs). However, PDE approximations in current use correspond
	to underlying axonal velocity distributions incompatible with experimental
	measurements. In order to rectify this deficiency, we here introduce
	novel propagation PDEs that give rise to smooth unimodal distributions
	of axonal conduction velocities. We also argue that velocities estimated
	from fibre diameters in slice and from latency measurements, respectively,
	relate quite differently to such distributions, a significant point
	for any phenomenological description. Our PDEs are then successfully
	fit to fibre diameter data from human corpus callosum and rat subcortical
	white matter. This allows for the first time to simulate long-range
	conduction in the mammalian brain with realistic, convenient PDEs.
	Furthermore, the obtained results suggest that the propagation of
	activity in rat and human differs significantly beyond mere scaling.
	The dynamical consequences of our new formulation are investigated
	in the context of a well known neural field model. On the basis of
	Turing instability analyses, we conclude that pattern formation is
	more easily initiated using our more realistic propagator. By increasing
	characteristic conduction velocities, a smooth transition can occur
	from self-sustaining bulk oscillations to travelling waves of various
	wavelengths, which may influence axonal growth during development.
	Our analytic results are also corroborated numerically using simulations
	on a large spatial grid. Thus we provide here a comprehensive analysis
	of empirically constrained activity propagation in the context of
	MFMs, which will allow more realistic studies of mammalian brain
	activity in the future.},

  abstract = {In 1995 when we began our investigations of the human visual system
	using fMRI, little was known about the temporal properties of the
	fMRI signal. Before we felt comfortable making quantitative estimates
	of neuronal responses with this new technique, we decided to first
	conduct a basic study of how the time-course of the fMRI response
	varied with stimulus timing and strength. The results ended up showing
	strong evidence that to a first approximation the hemodynamic transformation
	was linear in time. This was both important and remarkable: important
	because nearly all fMRI data analysis techniques assume or require
	linearity, and remarkable because the physiological basis of the
	hemodynamic transformation is so complex that we still have a far
	from complete understanding of it. In this paper, we provide highlights
	of the results of our original paper supporting the linear transform
	hypothesis. A reanalysis of the original data provides some interesting
	new insights into the published results. We also provide a detailed
	appendix describing of the properties and predictions of a linear
	system in time in the context of the transformation between neuronal
	responses and the BOLD signal.},

  abstract = {DCM is a platform for inferring the architecture of dynamical systems,
	combining a user-dependent model specification step with a Bayesian
	model selection scheme. In their critique of the model selection
	procedure, Lohmann et al confine themselves to models generated from
	the classic bilinear deterministic DCM. Although brief reference
	is made to recent modeling advances, such as stochastic DCM and nonlinear
	DCM, these are negatively cast as guilty of further exploding the
	combinatorial problem that is proposed to plague model selection.
	Yet this is only a problem if a naïve approach is adopted towards
	the model generation process. Where the user draws on prior knowledge
	of the system being modeled and the statistical properties of the
	particular data set, these advances can be employed precisely to
	address the type of concerns Lohmann et al raise in their exemplar
	analysis (Fig. 6). This note provides a putative generative model
	for their data by adding stochastic effects, using independent evidence
	to increase its biological plausibility and challenging the notion
	that model fit should be assessed using simple linear correlations.
	Rather than encouraging reliance on future developments in imaging
	hardware and data-driven multivariate algorithms, informed engagement
	with causal models of neuronal dynamics allows imaging researchers
	develop detailed theories of brain function across a broad range

	treats the cortex as a medium for the propagation of waves of electrical

	the onset of periodic and chaotic dynamics as well as multistability.
	Quantitative study of electrophysiological data supports the validity
	of these predictions. Hence, we argue that the core electrophysiological

  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the invasion and extinction of activity
	in heterogeneous neural fields. We first consider the effects of
	spatial heterogeneities on the propagation of an invasive activity
	front. In contrast to previous studies of front propagation in neural
	media, we assume that the front propagates into an unstable rather
	than a metastable zero-activity state. For sufficiently localized
	initial conditions, the asymptotic velocity of the resulting pulled
	front is given by the linear spreading velocity, which is determined
	by linearizing about the unstable state within the leading edge of
	the front. One of the characteristic features of these so-called
	pulled fronts is their sensitivity to perturbations inside the leading
	edge. This means that standard perturbation methods for studying
	the effects of spatial heterogeneities or external noise fluctuations
	break down. We show how to extend a partial differential equation
	method for analyzing pulled fronts in slowly modulated environments
	to the case of neural fields with slowly modulated synaptic weights.
	The basic idea is to rescale space and time so that the front becomes
	a sharp interface whose location can be determined by solving a corresponding
	local Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We use steepest descents to derive
	the Hamilton-Jacobi equation from the original nonlocal neural field
	equation. In the case of weak synaptic heterogenities, we then use
	perturbation theory to solve the corresponding Hamilton equations
	and thus determine the time-dependent wave speed. In the second part
	of the paper, we investigate how time-dependent heterogenities in
	the form of extrinsic multiplicative noise can induce rare noise-driven
	transitions to the zero-activity state, which now acts as an absorbing
	state signaling the extinction of all activity. In this case, the
	most probable path to extinction can be obtained by solving the classical
	equations of motion that dominate a path integral representation
	of the stochastic neural field in the weak noise limit. These equations
	take the form of nonlocal Hamilton equations in an infinite-dimensional

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with a striking visual experience: that of
	seeing geometric visual hallucinations. Hallucinatory images were
	classified by Klüver into four groups called form constants comprising
	(i) gratings, lattices, fretworks, filigrees, honeycombs and chequer-boards,
	(ii) cobwebs, (iii) tunnels, funnels, alleys, cones and vessels,
	and (iv) spirals. This paper describes a mathematical investigation
	of their origin based on the assumption that the patterns of connection
	between retina and striate cortex (henceforth referred to as V1)-the
	retinocortical map-and of neuronal circuits in V1, both local and
	lateral, determine their geometry. In the first part of the paper
	we show that form constants, when viewed in V1 coordinates, essentially
	correspond to combinations of plane waves, the wavelengths of which
	are integral multiples of the width of a human Hubel-Wiesel hypercolumn,
	ca. 1.33-2 mm. We next introduce a mathematical description of the
	large-scale dynamics of V1 in terms of the continuum limit of a lattice
	of interconnected hypercolumns, each of which itself comprises a
	number of interconnected iso-orientation columns. We then show that
	the patterns of interconnection in V1 exhibit a very interesting
	symmetry, i.e. they are invariant under the action of the planar
	Euclidean group E(2)-the group of rigid motions in the plane-rotations,
	reflections and translations. What is novel is that the lateral connectivity
	of V1 is such that a new group action is needed to represent its
	properties: by virtue of its anisotropy it is invariant with respect
	to certain shifts and twists of the plane. It is this shift-twist
	invariance that generates new representations of E(2). Assuming that
	the strength of lateral connections is weak compared with that of
	local connections, we next calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
	of the cortical dynamics, using Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation
	theory. The result is that in the absence of lateral connections,
	the eigenfunctions are degenerate, comprising both even and odd combinations
	of sinusoids in straight phi, the cortical label for orientation
	preference, and plane waves in r, the cortical position coordinate.
	'Switching-on' the lateral interactions breaks the degeneracy and
	either even or else odd eigenfunctions are selected. These results
	can be shown to follow directly from the Euclidean symmetry we have
	imposed. In the second part of the paper we study the nature of various
	even and odd combinations of eigenfunctions or planforms, the symmetries
	of which are such that they remain invariant under the particular
	action of E(2) we have imposed. These symmetries correspond to certain
	subgroups of E(2), the so-called axial subgroups. Axial subgroups
	are important in that the equivariant branching lemma indicates that
	when a symmetrical dynamical system becomes unstable, new solutions
	emerge which have symmetries corresponding to the axial subgroups
	of the underlying symmetry group. This is precisely the case studied
	in this paper. Thus we study the various planforms that emerge when
	our model V1 dynamics become unstable under the presumed action of
	hallucinogens or flickering lights. We show that the planforms correspond
	to the axial subgroups of E(2), under the shift-twist action. We
	then compute what such planforms would look like in the visual field,
	given an extension of the retinocortical map to include its action
	on local edges and contours. What is most interesting is that, given
	our interpretation of the correspondence between V1 planforms and
	perceived patterns, the set of planforms generates representatives
	of all the form constants. It is also noteworthy that the planforms
	derived from our continuum model naturally divide V1 into what are
	called linear regions, in which the pattern has a near constant orientation,
	reminiscent of the iso-orientation patches constructed via optical
	imaging. The boundaries of such regions form fractures whose points
	of intersection correspond to the well-known 'pinwheels'. To complete
	the study we then investigate the stability of the planforms, using

	medium where the diffusion process occurs. It provides a more general
	approach to disentangle complex fiber structures in biological tissues
	because it does not assume any particular model of diffusion; even
	so, it has a number of limitations that remain unstudied. For instance,
	the theoretical model used to compute the displacement pdf is based
	on a Fourier transformation defined in the whole measurement space;
	however, in practice, it is computed using discrete signals with
	a finite support. As a consequence, the displacement pdf obtained
	from the experiments is the convolution between the true pdf and
	a point spread function (PSF) that completely depends on the experimental
	sampling scheme. In this work, a general framework to rectify and
	decontaminate the displacement pdf reconstructed from DSI is introduced.
	This framework is based on model-free deconvolution techniques that
	allow obtaining clearer and sharper DSI estimates. The method was
	tested in synthetic data as well as in real data measured from a
	healthy human volunteer. The results demonstrated that the angular
	resolution of DSI can be increased, potentially revealing new real
	fiber components and reducing both the artefactual peaks and the
	uncertainty of the local diffusion orientational distribution. Furthermore,
	the deconvolution process provides scalar maps of quantities derived
	from the propagator, such as the zero displacement probability, with

  abstract = {Diffusion orientation transform (DOT) is a powerful imaging technique
	that allows the reconstruction of the microgeometry of fibrous tissues

	this methodology are the finite sampling of the q-space, the practical
	truncation of the series of spherical harmonics and the use of a
	mono-exponential model for the attenuation of the measured signal.
	In this work, a detailed mathematical description that provides an
	extension to the DOT methodology is presented. In particular, the
	limitations implied by the use of measurements with a finite support
	in q-space are investigated and clarified as well as the impact of
	the harmonic series truncation. Near- and far-field analytical patterns
	for the diffusion propagator are examined. The near-field pattern
	makes available the direct computation of the probability of return
	to the origin. The far-field pattern allows probing the limitations
	of the mono-exponential model, which suggests the existence of a
	limit of validity for DOT. In the regimen from moderate to large
	displacement lengths the isosurfaces of the diffusion propagator
	reveal aberrations in form of artifactual peaks. Finally, the major
	contribution of this work is the derivation of analytical equations
	that facilitate the accurate reconstruction of some orientational
	distribution functions (ODFs) and skewness ODFs that are relatively
	immune to these artifacts. The new formalism was tested using synthetic

	than the standard statistical analyses in the spatial domain. In
	line with these previous studies, the present report proposes a statistical
	analysis in the wavelet domain for the estimation of inter-group
	differences from structural MRI data. The procedure, called wavelet-based
	morphometry (WBM), was implemented under a voxel-based morphometry
	(VBM) style analysis. It was evaluated by comparing the gray-matter
	images of a group of 32 healthy subjects whose images were artificially
	altered to induce thinning of the cortex, with a different group
	of 32 healthy subjects whose images were unaltered. In order to quantify
	the performance of the reconstruction from a practical perspective,
	the same comparison was also conducted with standard VBM using SPM's
	Gaussian random fields and FSL's cluster-based statistics, family-wise
	error corrected, for datasets spatially-normalized via two different
	registration methods (i.e., SyN and FNIRT). The effect of using different
	amounts of smoothing, Battle-Lemarié filters and resolution levels
	in the wavelet transform was also investigated. Results support the
	proposed approach as a different and promising methodology to assess
	the structural morphometric differences between different populations
	of subjects.},

	(ACh) on its steady states, linear stability, spectrum, and temporal

	cables. Using a phase model approach, we show that the synchronous
	solution can change from a stable solution to an unstable one as
	the cable lengthens and the synaptic position moves further from
	the soma. We confirm this prediction using a system of coupled compartmental
	models. We also demonstrate that when the synchronous solution becomes
	unstable, a bifurcation occurs and a pair of asynchronous stable
	solutions appear, causing a phase lag between the cells in the system.
	Then using a variety of coupling functions and different synaptic
	positions, we show that distal connections and broad synaptic time
	courses encourage phase lags that can be reduced, eliminated, or
	enhanced by the presence of active currents in the dendrite. This
	mechanism may appear in neural systems where proximal connections
	could be used to encourage synchrony, and distal connections and
	broad synaptic time courses could be used to produce phase lags that
	can be modulated by active currents.},

  abstract = {The occurrence of so-called four dimensional chaos in dynamical systems
	represented by coupled, nonlinear, ordinary differential equations
	is rarely reported in the literature. In this paper, we present evidence
	that Liley's mesoscopic theory of the electroencephalogram (EEG),
	which has been used to describe brain activity in a variety of clinically
	relevant contexts, possesses a chaotic attractor with a Kaplan-Yorke
	dimension significantly larger than three. This accounts for simple,
	high order chaos for a physiologically admissible parameter set.
	Whilst the Lyapunov spectrum of the attractor has only one positive
	exponent, the contracting dimensions are such that the integer part
	of the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is three, thus giving rise to four
	dimensional chaos. A one-parameter bifurcation analysis with respect
	to the parameter corresponding to extracortical input is conducted,
	with results indicating that the origin of chaos is due to an inverse
	period doubling cascade. Hence, in the vicinity of the high order,
	strange attractor, the model is shown to display intermittent behavior,
	with random alternations between oscillatory and chaotic regimes.
	This phenomenon represents a possible dynamical justification of
	some of the typical features of clinically established EEG traces,

	However, their functional significance remains a matter of debate.
	Some of the mechanisms that generate these signals are known at the
	cellular level and rest on a balance of excitatory and inhibitory
	interactions within and between populations of neurons. The kinetics
	of the ensuing population dynamics determine the frequency of oscillations.
	In this work we extended the classical nonlinear lumped-parameter
	model of alpha rhythms, initially developed by Lopes da Silva and
	colleagues [Kybernetik 15 (1974) 27], to generate more complex dynamics.
	We show that the whole spectrum of MEG/EEG signals can be reproduced

	coupling strength and propagation delay on the rhythms generated
	by coupled cortical areas. The main findings were that (1) coupling
	induces phase-locked activity, with a phase shift of 0 or pi when
	the coupling is bidirectional, and (2) both coupling and propagation
	delay are critical determinants of the MEG/EEG spectrum. In forthcoming
	articles, we will use this model to (1) estimate how neuronal interactions

	validity of various indices of nonlinear coupling, and (2) generate

  abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate the mechanisms that shape
	evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) and magneto-encephalographic
	(MEG) responses. We used a neuronally plausible model to characterise
	the dependency of response components on the models parameters. This
	generative model was a neural mass model of hierarchically arranged
	areas using three kinds of inter-area connections (forward, backward
	and lateral). We investigated how responses, at each level of a cortical
	hierarchy, depended on the strength of connections or coupling. Our
	strategy was to systematically add connections and examine the responses
	of each successive architecture. We did this in the context of deterministic
	responses and then with stochastic spontaneous activity. Our aim
	was to show, in a simple way, how event-related dynamics depend on
	extrinsic connectivity. To emphasise the importance of nonlinear
	interactions, we tried to disambiguate the components of event-related
	potentials (ERPs) or event-related fields (ERFs) that can be explained
	by a linear superposition of trial-specific responses and those engendered
	nonlinearly (e.g., by phase-resetting). Our key conclusions were;
	(i) when forward connections, mediating bottom-up or extrinsic inputs,
	are sufficiently strong, nonlinear mechanisms cause a saturation
	of excitatory interneuron responses. This endows the system with
	an inherent stability that precludes nondissipative population dynamics.
	(ii) The duration of evoked transients increases with the hierarchical
	depth or level of processing. (iii) When backward connections are
	added, evoked transients become more protracted, exhibiting damped
	oscillations. These are formally identical to late or endogenous
	components seen empirically. This suggests that late components are
	mediated by reentrant dynamics within cortical hierarchies. (iv)
	Bilateral connections produce similar effects to backward connections
	but can also mediate zero-lag phase-locking among areas. (v) Finally,
	with spontaneous activity, ERPs/ERFs can arise from two distinct
	mechanisms: For low levels of (stimulus related and ongoing) activity,
	the systems response conforms to a quasi-linear superposition of
	separable responses to the fixed and stochastic inputs. This is consistent
	with classical assumptions that motivate trial averaging to suppress
	spontaneous activity and disclose the ERP/ERF. However, when activity
	is sufficiently high, there are nonlinear interactions between the
	fixed and stochastic inputs. This interaction is expressed as a phase-resetting
	and represents a qualitatively different explanation for the ERP/ERF.},

	understanding how event-related fields (ERFs) and potentials (ERPs)
	are generated. In this paper, we present a new approach to modeling
	event-related responses measured with EEG or MEG. This approach uses
	a biologically informed model to make inferences about the underlying
	neuronal networks generating responses. The approach can be regarded
	as a neurobiologically constrained source reconstruction scheme,
	in which the parameters of the reconstruction have an explicit neuronal
	interpretation. Specifically, these parameters encode, among other
	things, the coupling among sources and how that coupling depends
	upon stimulus attributes or experimental context. The basic idea
	is to supplement conventional electromagnetic forward models, of
	how sources are expressed in measurement space, with a model of how
	source activity is generated by neuronal dynamics. A single inversion
	of this extended forward model enables inference about both the spatial
	deployment of sources and the underlying neuronal architecture generating
	them. Critically, this inference covers long-range connections among
	well-defined neuronal subpopulations. In a previous paper, we simulated
	ERPs using a hierarchical neural-mass model that embodied bottom-up,
	top-down and lateral connections among remote regions. In this paper,
	we describe a Bayesian procedure to estimate the parameters of this
	model using empirical data. We demonstrate this procedure by characterizing
	the role of changes in cortico-cortical coupling, in the genesis
	of ERPs. In the first experiment, ERPs recorded during the perception
	of faces and houses were modeled as distinct cortical sources in
	the ventral visual pathway. Category-selectivity, as indexed by the
	face-selective N170, could be explained by category-specific differences
	in forward connections from sensory to higher areas in the ventral
	stream. We were able to quantify and make inferences about these
	effects using conditional estimates of connectivity. This allowed
	us to identify where, in the processing stream, category-selectivity
	emerged. In the second experiment, we used an auditory oddball paradigm
	to show that the mismatch negativity can be explained by changes
	in connectivity. Specifically, using Bayesian model selection, we
	assessed changes in backward connections, above and beyond changes
	in forward connections. In accord with theoretical predictions, there
	was strong evidence for learning-related changes in both forward
	and backward coupling. These examples show that category- or context-specific
	coupling among cortical regions can be assessed explicitly, within
	a mechanistic, biologically motivated inference framework.},

	dynamic mechanism) or by perturbing the systems coupling parameters
	(a structural mechanism) to produce induced responses. By applying
	conventional time-frequency analyses, we show that, in contradistinction
	to common conceptions, induced and evoked oscillations are perhaps
	more related than previously reported. Specifically, structural mechanisms
	normally associated with induced responses can be expressed in evoked
	power. Conversely, dynamic mechanisms posited for evoked responses
	can induce responses, if there is variation in neuronal input. We
	conclude, it may be better to consider evoked responses as the results
	of mixed dynamic and structural effects. We introduce adjusted power
	to complement induced power. Adjusted power is unaffected by trial-to-trial
	variations in input and can be attributed to structural perturbations
	without ambiguity.},

	simulations of networks of spiking neurons, with both negative and

	in porting models from one simulator to another. This impedes communication
	between investigators and makes it harder to reproduce and build
	on the work of others. On the other hand, simulation results can
	be cross-checked between different simulators, giving greater confidence
	in their correctness, and each simulator has different optimizations,
	so the most appropriate simulator can be chosen for a given modelling

	NEURON, NEST, PCSIM, Brian and the Heidelberg VLSI neuromorphic hardware).
	PyNN increases the productivity of neuronal network modelling by
	providing high-level abstraction, by promoting code sharing and reuse,

	the default-mode network, has been associated with daydreaming, free

	remain just below their oscillatory threshold. Time delay coupling
	based on lengths and strengths of primate corticocortical pathways
	leads to the emergence of 2 sets of 40-Hz oscillators. The sets showed

	been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics
	have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review
	and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of computational
	approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the
	cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational
	models at different space-time scales help us understand the fundamental
	mechanisms that underpin neural processes and relate these processes
	to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary
	because this is the level at which information is exchanged between
	the computing elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models
	tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior at
	the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models
	can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between
	large-scale neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus,
	and brain stem. Each level of description relates uniquely to neuroscience
	data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials
	to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram
	(EEG), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish
	which types of large-scale neuronal networks can perform computations
	and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field and related
	formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary
	role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data.
	This makes dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments.
	We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite

	patterns of correlated activity across different brain areas. The
	question of how resting-state functional connectivity (FC) emerges
	from the brain's anatomical connections has motivated several experimental
	and computational studies to understand structure-function relationships.
	However, the mechanistic origin of resting state is obscured by large-scale
	models' complexity, and a close structure-function relation is still
	an open problem. Thus, a realistic but simple enough description
	of relevant brain dynamics is needed. Here, we derived a dynamic
	mean field model that consistently summarizes the realistic dynamics
	of a detailed spiking and conductance-based synaptic large-scale
	network, in which connectivity is constrained by diffusion imaging
	data from human subjects. The dynamic mean field approximates the
	ensemble dynamics, whose temporal evolution is dominated by the longest
	time scale of the system. With this reduction, we demonstrated that
	FC emerges as structured linear fluctuations around a stable low
	firing activity state close to destabilization. Moreover, the model
	can be further and crucially simplified into a set of motion equations
	for statistical moments, providing a direct analytical link between
	anatomical structure, neural network dynamics, and FC. Our study
	suggests that FC arises from noise propagation and dynamical slowing
	down of fluctuations in an anatomically constrained dynamical system.
	Altogether, the reduction from spiking models to statistical moments
	presented here provides a new framework to explicitly understand
	the building up of FC through neuronal dynamics underpinned by anatomical
	connections and to drive hypotheses in task-evoked studies and for
	clinical applications.},

	large number of sources distributed on the cortical surface, formalized
	as a dynamical system, and (2) adaptive filters, as a natural solution

	This estimation framework relies on realistic physiological models,
	uses EEG and fMRI in a symmetric manner, and takes into account both
	their temporal and spatial information. We use the Kalman filter

	combining efficiently the information provided by the two modalities

	a random temporally and spatially smooth activity spread over the
	cortex. The Kalman filter and smoother show some limitations, however,

	First, they do not cope well with the strong nonlinearity in the
	model that is necessary for an adequate description of the relation
	between cortical electric activities and the metabolic demand responsible

	activation maps based on such model. Furthermore, as parameter estimation
	may leave much incertitude on the exact values of parameters, model

  abstract = {Consider an underdetermined system of linear equations y = Ax with
	known y and d x n matrix A. We seek the nonnegative x with the fewest
	nonzeros satisfying y = Ax. In general, this problem is NP-hard.
	However, for many matrices A there is a threshold phenomenon: if
	the sparsest solution is sufficiently sparse, it can be found by
	linear programming. We explain this by the theory of convex polytopes.
	Let a(j) denote the jth column of A, 1 < or = j < or = n, let a0
	= 0 and P denote the convex hull of the a(j). We say the polytope
	P is outwardly k-neighborly if every subset of k vertices not including
	0 spans a face of P. We show that outward k-neighborliness is equivalent
	to the statement that, whenever y = Ax has a nonnegative solution
	with at most k nonzeros, it is the nonnegative solution to y = Ax
	having minimal sum. We also consider weak neighborliness, where the
	overwhelming majority of k-sets of a(j)s not containing 0 span a
	face of P. This implies that most nonnegative vectors x with k nonzeros
	are uniquely recoverable from y = Ax by linear programming. Numerous
	corollaries follow by invoking neighborliness results. For example,
	for most large n by 2n underdetermined systems having a solution
	with fewer nonzeros than roughly half the number of equations, the
	sparsest solution can be found by linear programming.},

	Validation Engine resulted in a top ranking position with a mean

	on all baseline ADNI data, resulting in a very low failure rate.
	The segmentation accuracy of the method is better than two widely

	The other system acts as a generic external attention system (EAS)
	and mediates attention to exogenous stimuli. Reports that the DMN
	and EAS show anticorrelated activity across a range of experimental
	paradigms suggest that competition between these systems supports
	adaptive behavior. Here, we used functional MRI to characterize functional
	interactions between the DMN and different EAS components during
	performance of a recollection task known to coactivate regions of
	both networks. Using methods to isolate task-related, context-dependent

	are facilitated by a dynamic reconfiguration of the functional architecture
	of the DMN into core and transitional modules, with the latter serving
	to enhance integration with frontoparietal regions. In particular,
	the right posterior cingulate cortex may act as a critical information-processing

	approach, the brain is modeled as a graph comprising N nodes connected
	by M edges. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies,
	the nodes typically represent brain regions and the edges some measure
	of interaction between them. These nodes are commonly defined using
	a variety of regional parcellation templates, which can vary both
	in the volume sampled by each region, and the number of regions parcellated.
	Here, we sought to investigate how such variations in parcellation
	templates affect key graph analytic measures of functional brain
	organization using resting-state fMRI in 30 healthy volunteers. Seven
	different parcellation resolutions (84, 91, 230, 438, 890, 1314,
	and 4320 regions) were investigated. We found that gross inferences
	regarding network topology, such as whether the brain is small-world
	or scale-free, were robust to the template used, but that both absolute
	values of, and individual differences in, specific parameters such
	as path length, clustering, small-worldness, and degree distribution
	descriptors varied considerably across the resolutions studied. These
	findings underscore the need to consider the effect that a specific
	parcellation approach has on graph analytic findings in human fMRI
	studies, and indicate that results obtained using different templates
	may not be directly comparable.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is one of the oldest analgesics/adjuvant agents
	still in use today; however, its effects on the human electroencephalogram
	(EEG) remain unclear. It has been proposed that N(2)O may enhance
	higher-frequency EEG activity (often indicative of alert states and
	cognition) duration sedation. This possibly paradoxical effect has
	been used to explain the failure of many EEG monitors to capture
	the effects of N(2)O on patient state during anesthesia. To better
	understand the poor efficacy of current EEG approaches to monitoring
	N(2)O action, we quantitatively studied the sole effect of N(2)O
	on the resting EEG in healthy volunteers using multichannel EEG recordings
	under noise-minimized laboratory conditions.Healthy male volunteers
	were administered 20\% (n = 10), 40\% (n = 10), or 60\% (n = 5) inspired
	N(2)O mixed with oxygen during noise-shielded EEG recordings. N(2)O
	was administered over a 20-minute period involving a 5-minute equilibration
	period and 5-minute washout. EEG spectral edge frequency (95\%),
	median power frequency, total power, and band-limited power (δ, ,
	α, β, and γ) were used as quantitative EEG parameters. The changes
	in these EEG parameters were quantified throughout N(2)O inhalation
	and compared between predrug baseline, peak drug effect, and washout.Quantification
	of changes in spectral power during N(2)O inhalation showed only
	minor changes in estimates of spectral edge and median power frequency,
	whereas significant reductions in total power were observed at frontal
	sites during peak gas effect (P = 0.001; mean reduction [95\% confidence
	interval]: 41.90 μV(2) [18.19-65.61 μV(2)]) that rebounded during
	N(2)O washout. Such changes in total power were driven by shifts
	in low-frequency power (δ/), which were most elevated at frontal
	sites.Rather than directly enhancing high-frequency EEG power (β
	or γ bands), N(2)O seems to preserve the awake features of resting
	EEG (α band) and suppress power in those bands in which increases
	are typically associated with sedation/hypnosis (δ and ). These data
	suggest that N(2)O's suppression of low-frequency EEG power may help
	to explain previously reported difficulties in attempting to monitor
	patient state with the EEG during anesthesia involving N(2)O. Because
	increases in low-frequency power typically indicate increasing anesthesia,
	N(2)O's suppression of such activity and its rebound during washout
	would paradoxically influence EEG monitoring parameters. Therefore,
	correcting for such effects is expected to improve future monitoring
	methods.},

	(ODE) having a static nonlinearity. The model is called a KOe or
	a KOi set respectively; it is evaluated in the "open loop" state
	under deep anesthesia. Interactions in waking states are represented
	by coupled KO sets, respectively KIe (mutual excitation) and KIi
	(mutual inhibition). The coupled KIe and KIi sets form a KII set,

	The coupling of these three structures by both excitatory and inhibitory

	Due to the simplicity and generality of the elements of the model
	and their interconnections, the model can serve as the starting point
	for other neural systems that generate deterministic chaotic activity.},

  abstract = {The brain is widely assumed to be a paradigmatic example of a complex,
	self-organizing system. As such, it should exhibit the classic hallmarks
	of nonlinearity, multistability, and "nondiffusivity" (large coherent
	fluctuations). Surprisingly, at least at the very large scale of
	neocortical dynamics, there is little empirical evidence to support
	this, and hence most computational and methodological frameworks
	for healthy brain activity have proceeded very reasonably from a
	purely linear and diffusive perspective. By studying the temporal
	fluctuations of power in human resting-state electroencephalograms,
	we show that, although these simple properties may hold true at some
	temporal scales, there is strong evidence for bistability and nondiffusivity
	in key brain rhythms. Bistability is manifest as nonclassic bursting
	between high- and low-amplitude modes in the alpha rhythm. Nondiffusivity
	is expressed through the irregular appearance of high amplitude "extremal"
	events in beta rhythm power fluctuations. The statistical robustness
	of these observations was confirmed through comparison with Gaussian-rendered
	phase-randomized surrogate data. Although there is a good conceptual
	framework for understanding bistability in cortical dynamics, the
	implications of the extremal events challenge existing frameworks
	for understanding large-scale brain systems.},

	and widely studied attributes of ongoing cortical activity. Contrary
	to the prevalent notion that it simply "waxes and wanes," spontaneous
	alpha activity bursts erratically between two distinct modes of activity.
	We now establish a mechanism for this multistable phenomenon in resting-state
	cortical recordings by characterizing the complex dynamics of a biophysical
	model of macroscopic corticothalamic activity. This is achieved by
	studying the predicted activity of cortical and thalamic neuronal
	populations in this model as a function of its dynamic stability
	and the role of nonspecific synaptic noise. We hence find that fluctuating
	noisy inputs into thalamic neurons elicit spontaneous bursts between
	low- and high-amplitude alpha oscillations when the system is near
	a particular type of dynamical instability, namely a subcritical
	Hopf bifurcation. When the postsynaptic potentials associated with
	these noisy inputs are modulated by cortical feedback, the SD of
	power within each of these modes scale in proportion to their mean,
	showing remarkable concordance with empirical data. Our state-dependent
	corticothalamic model hence exhibits multistability and scale-invariant
	fluctuations-key features of resting-state cortical activity and
	indeed, of human perception, cognition, and behavior-thus providing
	a unified account of these apparently divergent phenomena.},

  abstract = {Multistability and scale-invariant fluctuations occur in a wide variety
	of biological organisms from bacteria to humans as well as financial,

	driven switches between multiple weakly stable states. Scale-invariant
	fluctuations arise when there is an approximately constant ratio
	between the mean and standard deviation of a system's fluctuations.
	Both are an important property of human perception, movement, decision
	making and computation and they occur together in the human alpha
	rhythm, imparting it with complex dynamical behavior. Here, we elucidate
	their fundamental dynamical mechanisms in a canonical model of nonlinear
	bifurcations under stochastic fluctuations. We find that the co-occurrence
	of multistability and scale-invariant fluctuations mandates two important
	dynamical properties: Multistability arises in the presence of a
	subcritical Hopf bifurcation, which generates co-existing attractors,
	whilst the introduction of multiplicative (state-dependent) noise
	ensures that as the system jumps between these attractors, fluctuations
	remain in constant proportion to their mean and their temporal statistics
	become long-tailed. The simple algebraic construction of this model
	affords a systematic analysis of the contribution of stochastic and

	challenge by dealing with the future and then turning to its history.
	The future of the Bayesian brain (in neuroimaging) is clear: it is
	the application of dynamic causal modeling to understand how the
	brain conforms to the free energy principle. In this context, the
	Bayesian brain is a corollary of the free energy principle, which
	says that any self organizing system (like a brain or neuroimaging
	community) must maximize the evidence for its own existence, which
	means it must minimize its free energy using a model of its world.
	Dynamic causal modeling involves finding models of the brain that
	have the greatest evidence or the lowest free energy. In short, the
	future of imaging neuroscience is to refine models of the brain to
	minimize free energy, where the brain refines models of the world
	to minimize free energy. This endeavor itself minimizes free energy
	because our community is itself a self organizing system. I cannot
	imagine an alternative future that has the same beautiful self consistency
	as mine. Having dispensed with the future, we can now focus on the
	past, which is much more interesting:},

	derived in both sensor and source-space. In other words, one can
	examine the cross-correlation or phase-delay functions between hidden
	neuronal sources using non-invasive data and relate these functions

	of responses to a stimulus that are incurred by a preceding stimulus.
	We have presented previously a model-free characterization of these
	effects using generic techniques from nonlinear system identification,
	namely a Volterra series formulation. At the same time Buxton et
	al. (1998) described a plausible and compelling dynamical model of
	hemodynamic signal transduction in fMRI. Subsequent work by Mandeville
	et al. (1999) provided important theoretical and empirical constraints
	on the form of the dynamic relationship between blood flow and volume
	that underpins the evolution of the fMRI signal. In this paper we
	combine these system identification and model-based approaches and
	ask whether the Balloon model is sufficient to account for the nonlinear
	behaviors observed in real time series. We conclude that it can,
	and furthermore the model parameters that ensue are biologically
	plausible. This conclusion is based on the observation that the Balloon
	model can produce Volterra kernels that emulate empirical kernels.
	To enable this evaluation we had to embed the Balloon model in a
	hemodynamic input-state-output model that included the dynamics of
	perfusion changes that are contingent on underlying synaptic activation.
	This paper presents (i) the full hemodynamic model (ii), how its
	associated Volterra kernels can be derived, and (iii) addresses the

	Distributing reviews to many reviewers would allow each reviewer
	to focus on portions of the article that reflect the reviewer's specialty
	or area of interest and place less of a burden on any one reviewer.
	Providing reviewers materials and methods to perform comprehensive
	evaluation would facilitate transparency, greater scrutiny, and replication

	assess reviewer contributions, which could be used to establish the
	impact of the reviewer in the scientific community. Quantifying review

	less dynamic intracortical circuits. Using existing PET data and

  abstract = {The temporal characteristics of the BOLD response in sensorimotor

	tapping while listening to metronome pacing tones. A repeated trial
	paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s and intertrial
	times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to be nonlinear in
	that the response to a long stimulus could not be predicted by convolving
	the 1-s response with a rectangular function. In the short-time regime,
	the amplitude of the response varied only slowly with stimulus duration.
	It was found that this character was predicted with a modification
	to Buxton's balloon model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur
	the response to concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at
	different temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While
	the measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the
	individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was found
	to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual rates.
	Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the response to
	fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is effective when
	the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The deconvolution filter
	must be measured for each subject using a short-stimulus paradigm.
	It is concluded that deconvolution may be effective in diminishing
	the hemodynamically imposed temporal blurring and may have potential

	pulses, inhibitory neurons fire a short time before or after the
	excitatory neurons. During slow pulses, inhibitory cells fire well
	before neighboring excitatory cells, and potentials of excitatory
	cells become negative and then positive before they fire. There is
	a bistable parameter regime in which both fast and slow pulses can
	propagate. Fast pulses can propagate at low levels of inhibition,
	are affected by fast excitation but are almost unaffected by slow
	excitation, and are easily elicited by stimulating groups of neurons.
	In contrast, slow pulses can propagate at intermediate levels of
	inhibition, and are difficult to evoke. They can propagate without
	slow excitation, but slow excitation makes their propagation substantially
	more robust. Fast pulses can propagate in a wider parameter regime
	if inhibition decays slowly with time, whereas slow pulses can propagate
	in a wider parameter regime if the passive time constant of inhibitory
	cells is large. Strong inhibitory-to-inhibitory conductance eliminates
	the slow pulses and converts the fast traveling pulses into irregular
	pulses, in which the inhibitory neurons segregate into two groups
	that have different firing delays with respect to their neighboring
	excitatory cells. In general, the velocity of the fast pulse increases
	with the axonal conductance velocity c, but there are cases in which
	it decreases with c. We suggest that the fast and slow pulses observed
	in our model correspond to the fast and slow propagating activity

	underlying the structural and functional organization of the brain

	anatomical connectivity networks in the human brain remains scarce.
	Here, we utilized diffusion tensor imaging deterministic tractography
	to construct a macroscale anatomical network capturing the underlying
	common connectivity pattern of human cerebral cortex in a large sample
	of subjects (80 young adults) and further quantitatively analyzed
	its topological properties with graph theoretical approaches. The
	cerebral cortex was divided into 78 cortical regions, each representing
	a network node, and 2 cortical regions were considered connected
	if the probability of fiber connections exceeded a statistical criterion.
	The topological parameters of the established cortical network (binarized)
	resemble that of a "small-world" architecture characterized by an
	exponentially truncated power-law distribution. These characteristics
	imply high resilience to localized damage. Furthermore, this cortical
	network was characterized by major hub regions in association cortices
	that were connected by bridge connections following long-range white
	matter pathways. Our results are compatible with previous structural
	and functional brain networks studies and provide insight into the
	organizational principles of human brain anatomical networks that

	signals. Given the actual M/EEG measurements and the solution of
	this forward problem, one can localize, in space and in time, the
	brain regions that have produced the recorded data. However, due
	to the physics of the problem, the limited number of sensors compared
	to the number of possible source locations, and measurement noise,
	this inverse problem is ill-posed. Consequently, additional constraints
	are needed. Classical inverse solvers, often called minimum norm
	estimates (MNE), promote source estimates with a small ℓ₂ norm. Here,
	we consider a more general class of priors based on mixed norms.
	Such norms have the ability to structure the prior in order to incorporate
	some additional assumptions about the sources. We refer to such solvers
	as mixed-norm estimates (MxNE). In the context of M/EEG, MxNE can
	promote spatially focal sources with smooth temporal estimates with
	a two-level ℓ₁/ℓ₂ mixed-norm, while a three-level mixed-norm can
	be used to promote spatially non-overlapping sources between different
	experimental conditions. In order to efficiently solve the optimization
	problems of MxNE, we introduce fast first-order iterative schemes
	that for the ℓ₁/ℓ₂ norm give solutions in a few seconds making such
	a prior as convenient as the simple MNE. Furthermore, thanks to the
	convexity of the optimization problem, we can provide optimality
	conditions that guarantee global convergence. The utility of the

  abstract = {Interpreting and controlling bioelectromagnetic phenomena require
	realistic physiological models and accurate numerical solvers. A

	This simplified model makes it possible to use Boundary Element Methods.
	Unfortunately, most Boundary Element solutions are confronted with

	is high, as for instance the scalp/skull conductivity ratio in electro-encephalography.
	To overcome this difficulty, we proposed a new method called the

	aim of this paper is to present OpenMEEG, both from the theoretical
	and the practical point of view, and to compare its performances
	with other competing software packages.We have run a benchmark study
	in the field of electro- and magneto-encephalography, in order to
	compare the accuracy of OpenMEEG with other freely distributed forward
	solvers. We considered spherical models, for which analytical solutions
	exist, and we designed randomized meshes to assess the variability
	of the accuracy. Two measures were used to characterize the accuracy.
	the Relative Difference Measure and the Magnitude ratio. The comparisons
	were run, either with a constant number of mesh nodes, or a constant
	number of unknowns across methods. Computing times were also compared.We
	observed more pronounced differences in accuracy in electroencephalography

	three categories: the linear collocation methods, that run very fast
	but with low accuracy, the linear collocation methods with isolated
	skull approach for which the accuracy is improved, and OpenMEEG that
	clearly outperforms the others. As far as speed is concerned, OpenMEEG
	is on par with the other methods for a constant number of unknowns,
	and is hence faster for a prescribed accuracy level.This study clearly
	shows that OpenMEEG represents the state of the art for forward computations.
	Moreover, our software development strategies have made it handy

	of separate features into a single percept ("binding") is associated
	with coherent gamma band activity across the cortical areas involved.
	Therefore, it would be of utmost interest to image cortico-cortical
	coherence in the working human brain. The frequency specificity and
	transient nature of these interactions requires time-sensitive tools
	such as magneto- or electroencephalography (MEG/EEG). Coherence between
	signals of sensors covering different scalp areas is commonly taken
	as a measure of functional coupling. However, this approach provides
	vague information on the actual cortical areas involved, owing to
	the complex relation between the active brain areas and the sensor
	recordings. We propose a solution to the crucial issue of proceeding
	beyond the MEG sensor level to estimate coherences between cortical
	areas. Dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) uses a spatial
	filter to localize coherent brain regions and provides the time courses
	of their activity. Reference points for the computation of neural
	coupling may be based on brain areas of maximum power or other physiologically
	meaningful information, or they may be estimated starting from sensor
	coherences. The performance of DICS is evaluated with simulated data
	and illustrated with recordings of spontaneous activity in a healthy
	subject and a parkinsonian patient. Methods for estimating functional
	connectivities between brain areas will facilitate characterization
	of cortical networks involved in sensory, motor, or cognitive tasks

	high degree, strength, and betweenness centrality, and they constitute
	connector hubs that link all major structural modules. The structural
	core contains brain regions that form the posterior components of
	the human default network. Looking both within and outside of core
	regions, we observed a substantial correspondence between structural

	the same participants. The spatial and topological centrality of
	the core within cortex suggests an important role in functional integration.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to inverting (fitting) models of
	coupled dynamical systems based on state-of-the-art (cubature) Kalman
	filtering. Crucially, this inversion furnishes posterior estimates
	of both the hidden states and parameters of a system, including any
	unknown exogenous input. Because the underlying generative model
	is formulated in continuous time (with a discrete observation process)
	it can be applied to a wide variety of models specified with either
	ordinary or stochastic differential equations. These are an important
	class of models that are particularly appropriate for biological
	time-series, where the underlying system is specified in terms of
	kinetics or dynamics (i.e., dynamic causal models). We provide comparative
	evaluations with generalized Bayesian filtering (dynamic expectation
	maximization) and demonstrate marked improvements in accuracy and
	computational efficiency. We compare the schemes using a series of
	difficult (nonlinear) toy examples and conclude with a special focus
	on hemodynamic models of evoked brain responses in fMRI. Our scheme
	promises to provide a significant advance in characterizing the functional
	architectures of distributed neuronal systems, even in the absence
	of known exogenous (experimental) input; e.g., resting state fMRI
	studies and spontaneous fluctuations in electrophysiological studies.
	Importantly, unlike current Bayesian filters (e.g. DEM), our scheme
	provides estimates of time-varying parameters, which we will exploit
	in future work on the adaptation and enabling of connections in the
	brain.},

	with functionally defined V1, demonstrating this in human has not

	In this study we use MRI to measure the anatomical and functional
	V1 boundaries in the same individual and demonstrate close agreement
	between them. Functional V1 location was measured by parcellating
	occipital cortex of 10 living humans into visual cortical areas based
	on the topographic map of the visual field measured using functional

	using a surface-based probabilistic atlas derived from high-resolution
	structural MRI of the stria of Gennari in 10 intact ex vivo human
	hemispheres. To ensure that the atlas prediction was correct, it
	was validated against V1 location measured using an observer-independent
	cortical parcellation based on the laminar pattern of cell density
	in serial brain sections from 10 separate individuals. The close
	agreement between the independent anatomically and functionally derived
	V1 boundaries indicates that the whole extent of V1 can be accurately
	predicted based on cortical surface reconstructions computed from
	structural MRI scans, eliminating the need for functional localizers
	of V1. In addition, that the primary cortical folds predict the location
	of functional V1 suggests that the mechanism giving rise to V1 location

	The mechanism of how such alterations in functional connectivity

	as yet poorly understood. Here we use a modeling approach to explore
	the way in which this can arise and to highlight the important role
	that local population dynamics can have in shaping emergent spatial
	functional connectivity patterns. The local dynamics for a neural
	population is taken to be of the Wilson-Cowan type, whilst the structural
	connectivity patterns used, describing long-range anatomical connections,
	cover both realistic scenarios (from the CoComac database) and idealized
	ones that allow for more detailed theoretical study. We have calculated
	graph-theoretic measures of functional network topology from numerical
	simulations of model networks. The effect of the form of local dynamics
	on the observed network state is quantified by examining the correlation
	between structural and functional connectivity. We document a profound
	and systematic dependence of the simulated functional connectivity
	patterns on the parameters controlling the dynamics. Importantly,
	we show that a weakly coupled oscillator theory explaining these
	correlations and their variation across parameter space can be developed.
	This theoretical development provides a novel way to characterize

  abstract = {To understand the effects of a cortical lesion it is necessary to
	consider not only the loss of local neural function, but also the
	lesion-induced changes in the larger network of endogenous oscillatory
	interactions in the brain. To investigate how network embedding influences
	a region's functional role, and the consequences of its being damaged,
	we implement two models of oscillatory cortical interactions, both
	of which inherit their coupling architecture from the available anatomical
	connection data for macaque cerebral cortex. In the first model,
	node dynamics are governed by Kuramoto phase oscillator equations,
	and we investigate the sequence in which areas entrain one another
	in the transition to global synchrony. In the second model, node
	dynamics are governed by a more realistic neural mass model, and
	we assess long-run inter-regional interactions using a measure of
	directed information flow. Highly connected parietal and frontal
	areas are found to synchronize most rapidly, more so than equally
	highly connected visual and somatosensory areas, and this difference
	can be explained in terms of the network's clustered architecture.
	For both models, lesion effects extend beyond the immediate neighbors
	of the lesioned site, and the amplitude and dispersal of nonlocal
	effects are again influenced by cluster patterns in the network.
	Although the consequences of in vivo lesions will always depend on
	circuitry local to the damaged site, we conclude that lesions of
	parietal regions (especially areas 5 and 7a) and frontal regions
	(especially areas 46 and FEF) have the greatest potential to disrupt

  abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations
	are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured
	using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations,
	those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional
	connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural
	(anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the
	present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling,
	whether systems-level properties of functional networks--including
	their spatial statistics and their persistence across time--can be
	accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network.
	We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and
	structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography)
	in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity
	then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics.
	In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections
	commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection,
	rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional
	connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional
	distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity
	that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii)
	that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within
	and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical
	and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional
	connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions
	without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and
	spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale
	anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

	technologies have been developed for characterizing the connective
	anatomy of intra-regional circuits and inter-regional fiber pathways.
	It will soon be possible to build computational models that incorporate
	these newly detailed structural network measurements to make predictions
	of neural dynamics at multiple scales. Here, we review the practicality
	and the value of these efforts, while at the same time considering
	in which cases and to what extent structure does determine neural
	function. Studies of the healthy brain, of neural development, and
	of pathology all yield examples of direct correspondences between
	structural linkage and dynamical correlation. Theoretical arguments
	further support the notion that brain network topology and spatial

	range of empirical neurodynamic features, our present large-scale
	models can already predict the macroscopic pattern of dynamic correlation

  abstract = {Our goal is to study the human brain anatomical network. For this,
	the anatomical connection probabilities (ACP) between 90 cortical
	and subcortical brain gray matter areas are estimated from diffusion-weighted
	Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) techniques. The ACP between any
	two areas gives the probability that those areas are connected at
	least by a single nervous fiber. Then, the brain is modeled as a
	non-directed weighted graph with continuous arc weights given by
	the ACP matrix. Based on this approach, complex networks properties
	such as small-world attributes, efficiency, degree distribution,
	vulnerability, betweenness centrality and motifs composition are
	studied. The analysis was carried out for 20 right-handed healthy
	subjects (mean age: 31.10, S.D.: 7.43). According to the results,
	all networks have small-world and broad-scale characteristics. Additionally,
	human brain anatomical networks present bigger local efficiency and
	smaller global efficiency than the corresponding random networks.
	In a vulnerability and betweenness centrality analysis, the most
	indispensable and critical anatomical areas were identified: putamens,
	precuneus, insulas, superior parietals and superior frontals. Interestingly,
	some areas have a negative vulnerability (e.g. superior temporal
	poles, pallidums, supramarginals and hechls), which suggest that
	even at the cost of losing in global anatomical efficiency, these
	structures were maintained through the evolutionary processes due
	to their important functions. Finally, symmetrical characteristic
	building blocks (motifs) of size 3 and 4 were calculated, obtaining
	that motifs of size 4 are the expanded version of motif of size 3.
	These results are in agreement with previous anatomical studies in
	the cat and macaque cerebral cortex.},

	Coupling two models, with delays in the interconnections to simulate
	the synaptic connections within and between cortical areas, made
	it possible to replicate the spatial distribution of alpha and beta

  year = {2013},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {39},
  abstract = {The basal ganglia play a crucial role in the execution of movements,
	as demonstrated by the severe motor deficits that accompany Parkinson's
	disease (PD). Since motor commands originate in the cortex, an important
	question is how the basal ganglia influence cortical information
	flow, and how this influence becomes pathological in PD. To explore
	this, we developed a composite neuronal network/neural field model.
	The network model consisted of 4950 spiking neurons, divided into
	15 excitatory and inhibitory cell populations in the thalamus and
	cortex. The field model consisted of the cortex, thalamus, striatum,
	subthalamic nucleus, and globus pallidus. Both models have been separately
	validated in previous work. Three field models were used: one with
	basal ganglia parameters based on data from healthy individuals,
	one based on data from individuals with PD, and one purely thalamocortical
	model. Spikes generated by these field models were then used to drive
	the network model. Compared to the network driven by the healthy
	model, the PD-driven network had lower firing rates, a shift in spectral
	power toward lower frequencies, and higher probability of bursting;
	each of these findings is consistent with empirical data on PD. In
	the healthy model, we found strong Granger causality between cortical
	layers in the beta and low gamma frequency bands, but this causality
	was largely absent in the PD model. In particular, the reduction
	in Granger causality from the main "input" layer of the cortex (layer
	4) to the main "output" layer (layer 5) was pronounced. This may
	account for symptoms of PD that seem to reflect deficits in information
	flow, such as bradykinesia. In general, these results demonstrate
	that the brain's large-scale oscillatory environment, represented
	here by the field model, strongly influences the information processing
	that occurs within its subnetworks. Hence, it may be preferable to
	drive spiking network models with physiologically realistic inputs
	rather than pure white noise.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe a temporal model for event-related potentials
	(ERP) in the context of statistical parametric mapping (SPM). In
	brief, we project channel data onto a two-dimensional scalp surface
	or into three-dimensional brain space using some appropriate inverse
	solution. We then treat the spatiotemporal data in a mass-univariate
	fashion. This implicitly factorises the model into spatial and temporal
	components. The key contribution of this paper is the use of observation
	models that afford an explicit distinction between observation error
	and variation in the expression of ERPs. This distinction is created
	by employing a two-level hierarchical model, in which the first level
	models the ERP effects within-subject and trial type, while the second
	models differences in ERP expression among trial types and subjects.
	By bringing the analysis of ERP data into a classical hierarchical
	(i.e., mixed effects) framework, many apparently disparate approaches
	(e.g., conventional P300 analyses and time-frequency analyses of
	stimulus-locked oscillations) can be reconciled within the same estimation
	and inference procedure. Inference proceeds in the normal way using
	t or F statistics to test for effects that are localised in peristimulus
	time or in some time-frequency window. The use of F statistics is
	an important generalisation of classical approaches, because it allows
	one to test for effects that lie in a multidimensional subspace (i.e.,
	of unknown but constrained form). We describe the analysis procedures,
	the underlying theory and compare its performance to established

	a critical role in these analyses, by allowing one to compare equally

  abstract = {Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(fMRI) data allows one to make inferences about the architecture
	of distributed networks in the brain, in terms of effective connectivity.
	fMRI data are usually acquired using echo planar imaging (EPI). EPI
	sequences typically acquire slices at different times over a few
	seconds. DCM, in its original inception, was not informed about these
	slice timings and assumed that all slices were acquired simultaneously.
	It has been shown that DCM can cope with slice timing differences
	of up to 1 s. However, many fMRI studies employ a repetition time
	(TR) of 3 to 5 s, which precludes a straightforward DCM of these
	data. We show that this limitation can be overcome easily by including
	slice timing in the DCM. Using synthetic data we show that the extended
	DCM furnishes veridical posterior means, even if there are large
	slice-timing differences. Model comparisons show that, in general,
	the extended DCM out-performs the original model. We contrast the
	modeling of slice timing, in the context of DCM, with the less effective
	approach of 'slice-timing correction', prior to modeling. We apply
	our procedure to real data and show that slice timings are important
	parameters. We conclude that, generally, one should use DCM with
	slice timing.},

  abstract = {Gamma rhythms (30-100 Hz) are an extensively studied synchronous brain
	state responsible for a number of sensory, memory, and motor processes.
	Experimental evidence suggests that fast-spiking interneurons are
	responsible for carrying the high frequency components of the rhythm,
	while regular-spiking pyramidal neurons fire sparsely. We propose
	that a combination of spike frequency adaptation and global inhibition
	may be responsible for this behavior. Excitatory neurons form several
	clusters that fire every few cycles of the fast oscillation. This
	is first shown in a detailed biophysical network model and then analyzed
	thoroughly in an idealized model. We exploit the fact that the timescale
	of adaptation is much slower than that of the other variables. Singular
	perturbation theory is used to derive an approximate periodic solution
	for a single spiking unit. This is then used to predict the relationship
	between the number of clusters arising spontaneously in the network
	as it relates to the adaptation time constant. We compare this to
	a complementary analysis that employs a weak coupling assumption
	to predict the first Fourier mode to destabilize from the incoherent
	state of an associated phase model as the external noise is reduced.
	Both approaches predict the same scaling of cluster number with respect
	to the adaptation time constant, which is corroborated in numerical
	simulations of the full system. Thus, we develop several testable
	predictions regarding the formation and characteristics of gamma
	rhythms with sparsely firing excitatory neurons.},

  abstract = {Self-organized criticality is an attractive model for human brain
	dynamics, but there has been little direct evidence for its existence
	in large-scale systems measured by neuroimaging. In general, critical
	systems are associated with fractal or power law scaling, long-range
	correlations in space and time, and rapid reconfiguration in response
	to external inputs. Here, we consider two measures of phase synchronization:
	the phase-lock interval, or duration of coupling between a pair of
	(neurophysiological) processes, and the lability of global synchronization
	of a (brain functional) network. Using computational simulations
	of two mechanistically distinct systems displaying complex dynamics,
	the Ising model and the Kuramoto model, we show that both synchronization
	metrics have power law probability distributions specifically when
	these systems are in a critical state. We then demonstrate power
	law scaling of both pairwise and global synchronization metrics in
	functional MRI and magnetoencephalographic data recorded from normal
	volunteers under resting conditions. These results strongly suggest
	that human brain functional systems exist in an endogenous state
	of dynamical criticality, characterized by a greater than random
	probability of both prolonged periods of phase-locking and occurrence
	of large rapid changes in the state of global synchronization, analogous
	to the neuronal "avalanches" previously described in cellular systems.
	Moreover, evidence for critical dynamics was identified consistently
	in neurophysiological systems operating at frequency intervals ranging
	from 0.05-0.11 to 62.5-125 Hz, confirming that criticality is a property
	of human brain functional network organization at all frequency intervals
	in the brain's physiological bandwidth.},

	if the columns within its boundaries constituted a slightly unbalanced
	sample of columnar selectivities (Kamitani and Tong, 2005), providing
	a possible mechanism for fMRI hyperacuity. However, Op de Beeck (2009)
	suggests that a coarse-scale neuronal organization rather than fMRI
	hyperacuity may explain the presence of the information in the fMRI
	patterns. Here we argue (a) that the present evidence does not rule
	out fMRI hyperacuity, (b) that the mechanism originally suggested
	for fMRI hyperacuity (biased sampling by averaging within each voxel's
	boundaries; Kamitani and Tong, 2005) will only produce very weak
	sensitivity to fine-grained pattern information, and (c) that an
	alternative mechanism (voxel as complex spatiotemporal filter) is
	physiologically more accurate and promises stronger sensitivity to
	fine-grained pattern information: We know that each voxel samples
	the neuronal activity pattern through a unique fine-grained structure
	of venous vessels that supply its blood oxygen level-dependent signal.
	At the simplest level, the drainage domain of a venous vessel may
	sample the neuronal pattern with a selectivity bias (Gardner, 2009;
	Shmuel et al., 2009). Beyond biased drainage domains, we illustrate
	with a simple simulation how temporal properties of the hemodynamics
	(e.g., the speed of the blood in the capillary bed) can shape spatial
	properties of a voxel's filter (e.g., how finely structured it is).
	This suggests that a voxel, together with its signal-supplying vasculature,
	may best be thought of as a complex spatiotemporal filter. Such a
	filter may well have greater sensitivity to high spatial frequencies
	than the Gaussian or averaging-box kernels typically invoked to characterize
	voxel sampling (compact kernels, both of which would act like anti-aliasing
	filters that minimize such sensitivity). Importantly, the complex-spatiotemporal-filter
	hypothesis of fMRI hyperacuity can account for the observed robustness
	to slight shifts of the voxel grid caused by head motion: Because
	the fine-grained components of the filter are vascular, they will
	remain in a constant relationship to the neuronal patterns sampled
	as the voxel grid is slightly shifted.},

  abstract = {Polygon-mesh representations of the cortices of individual subjects
	are of anatomical interest, aid visualization of functional imaging
	data and provide important constraints for their statistical analysis.
	Due to noise and partial volume sampling, however, conventional segmentation
	methods rarely yield a voxel object whose outer boundary represents
	the folded cortical sheet without topological errors. These errors,
	called handles, have particularly deleterious effects when the polygon
	mesh constructed from the segmented voxel representation is inflated
	or flattened. So far handles had to be removed by cumbersome manual
	editing, or the computationally more expensive method of reconstruction
	by morphing had to be used, incorporating the a priori constraint
	of simple topology into the polygon-mesh model. Here we describe
	a linear time complexity algorithm that automatically detects and
	removes handles in presegmentations of the cortex obtained by conventional
	methods. The algorithm's modifications reflect the true structure
	of the cortical sheet. The core component of our method is a region
	growing process that starts deep inside the object, is prioritized
	by the distance-to-surface of the voxels considered for inclusion
	and is selftouching-sensitive, i.e., voxels whose inclusion would
	add a handle are never included. The result is a binary voxel object
	identical to the initial object except for "cuts" located in the
	thinnest part of each handle. By applying the same method to the
	inverse object, an alternative set of solutions is determined, correcting
	the errors by addition instead of deletion of voxels. For each handle
	separately, the solution more consistent with the intensities of
	the original anatomical MR scan is chosen. The accuracy of the resulting
	polygon-mesh reconstructions has been validated by visual inspection,
	by quantitative comparison to an expert's manual corrections, and
	by crossvalidation between reconstructions from different scans of
	the same subject's cortex.},

	example, automated detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in very
	short heart beat interval time series would be useful in patients
	with cardiac implantable electronic devices that record only from
	the ventricle. Such devices require efficient algorithms, and the
	clinical situation demands accuracy. Toward these ends, we optimized
	the sample entropy measure, which reports the probability that short
	templates will match with others within the series. We developed
	general methods for the rational selection of the template length
	m and the tolerance matching r. The major innovation was to allow
	r to vary so that sufficient matches are found for confident entropy
	estimation, with conversion of the final probability to a density
	by dividing by the matching region volume, 2r(m). The optimized sample
	entropy estimate and the mean heart beat interval each contributed
	to accurate detection of AF in as few as 12 heartbeats. The final
	algorithm, called the coefficient of sample entropy (COSEn), was
	developed using the canonical MIT-BIH database and validated in a
	new and much larger set of consecutive Holter monitor recordings
	from the University of Virginia. In patients over the age of 40 yr
	old, COSEn has high degrees of accuracy in distinguishing AF from
	normal sinus rhythm in 12-beat calculations performed hourly. The
	most common errors are atrial or ventricular ectopy, which increase
	entropy despite sinus rhythm, and atrial flutter, which can have
	low or high entropy states depending on dynamics of atrioventricular
	conduction.},

	Furthermore, Bayesian model comparison favoured those models when
	bilinear effects corresponded to their implementation in the neural
	model. These findings generalised to an extended model with two additional
	areas and reentrant circuits. The conditional uncertainty of coupling
	parameter estimates increased in proportion to the number of incorrectly
	specified regions. These results highlight the role of neural models

  abstract = {The burst-suppression pattern is well recognized as a distinct feature
	of the mammalian electroencephalogram (EEG) waveform. Consisting
	of alternating periods of high amplitude oscillatory and isoelectric
	activity, it can be induced in health by deep anesthesia as well
	as being evoked by a range of pathophysiological processes that include
	coma and anoxia. While the electroencephalographic phenomenon and
	clinical implications of burst suppression have been studied extensively,
	the physiological mechanisms underlying its emergence remain unresolved
	and obscure. Because electroencephalographic bursting phenomenologically
	resembles the bursting observed in single neurons, it would be reasonable
	to assume that the theoretical insights developed to understand bursting
	at the cellular ("microscopic") level would enable insights into
	the dynamical genesis of bursting at the level of the whole brain
	("macroscopic"). In general action potential bursting is the result
	of the interplay of two time scales: a fast time scale responsible
	for spiking, and a slow time scale that modulates such activity.
	We therefore hypothesize that such fast-slow systems dynamically
	underpin electroencephalographic bursting. Here we show that a well-known
	mean field dynamical model of the electroencephalogram, the Liley
	model, while unable to produce burst suppression unmodified, is able
	to give rise to a wide variety of burst-like activity by the addition
	of one or more slow systems modulating model parameters speculated
	to be major "targets" for anesthetic action. The development of a
	physiologically plausible theoretical framework to account for burst
	suppression will lead to a more complete physiological understanding
	of the EEG and the mechanisms that serve to modify ongoing brain
	activity necessary for purposeful behavior and consciousness.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has rapidly become an important tool
	in clinical medicine and biological research. Its functional variant
	(functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI) is currently the most
	widely used method for brain mapping and studying the neural basis
	of human cognition. While the method is widespread, there is insufficient
	knowledge of the physiological basis of the fMRI signal to interpret
	the data confidently with respect to neural activity. This paper
	reviews the basic principles of MRI and fMRI, and subsequently discusses
	in some detail the relationship between the blood-oxygen-level-dependent
	(BOLD) fMRI signal and the neural activity elicited during sensory
	stimulation. To examine this relationship, we conducted the first
	simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and BOLD
	responses. Depending on the temporal characteristics of the stimulus,
	a moderate to strong correlation was found between the neural activity
	measured with microelectrodes and the BOLD signal averaged over a
	small area around the microelectrode tips. However, the BOLD signal
	had significantly higher variability than the neural activity, indicating
	that human fMRI combined with traditional statistical methods underestimates
	the reliability of the neuronal activity. To understand the relative
	contribution of several types of neuronal signals to the haemodynamic
	response, we compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and
	multi-unit activity (MUA) with high spatio-temporal fMRI responses
	recorded simultaneously in monkey visual cortex. At recording sites
	characterized by transient responses, only the LFP signal was significantly
	correlated with the haemodynamic response. Furthermore, the LFPs
	had the largest magnitude signal and linear systems analysis showed
	that the LFPs were better than the MUAs at predicting the fMRI responses.
	These findings, together with an analysis of the neural signals,
	indicate that the BOLD signal primarily measures the input and processing
	of neuronal information within a region and not the output signal
	transmitted to other brain regions.},

  abstract = {Brains are restless. We have long known of the existence of a great
	deal of uninterrupted brain activity that maintains the body in a
	stable state--from an evolutionary standpoint one of the brain's
	most ancient tasks. But intrinsic, ongoing activity is not limited
	to subcortical, life-maintaining structures; cortex, too, is remarkably
	active even in the absence of a sensory stimulus or a specific behavioral
	task. This is evident both in its enormous energy consumption at
	rest and in the large, spontaneous but coherent fluctuations of neural
	activity that spread across different areas. Not surprisingly, a
	growing number of electrophysiological and functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI) studies are appearing that report on various aspects
	of the brain's spontaneous activity or "default mode" of operation.
	One recent study reports results from simultaneously combined electrophysiological
	and fMRI measurements in the monkey visual cortex (Shmuel, A., Leopold,
	D.A., 2008. Neuronal correlates of spontaneous fluctuations in fMRI
	signals in monkey visual cortex: implications for functional connectivity
	at rest. Hum. Brain Mapp. 29, 751-761). The authors claim to be able
	to demonstrate correlations between slow fluctuations in blood-oxygen-level-dependent
	(BOLD) signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying, locally
	measured neuronal activity. They even go on to speculate that the
	fluctuations display wave-like spatiotemporal patterns across cortex.
	In the present report, however, we re-analyze the data presented
	in that study and demonstrate that the measurements were not actually
	taken during rest. Visual cortex was subject to almost imperceptible
	but physiologically clearly detectable flicker induced by the visual
	stimulator. An examination of the power spectral density of the neural
	responses and the neurovascular impulse response function shows that
	such imperceptible flicker strongly suppresses the slow oscillations
	and changes the degree of covariance between neural and vascular
	signals. In addition, a careful analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns
	demonstrates that no slow waves of activity exist in visual cortex;
	instead, the presented wave data reflect differences in signal-to-noise
	ratio at various cortical sites due to local differences in vascularization.
	In this report, assuming that the term "spontaneous activity" refers
	to intrinsic physiological processes at the absence of sensory inputs
	or motor outputs, we discuss the need for careful selection of experimental
	protocols and of examining the degree to which the activation of
	sensory areas might influence the cortical or subcortical processes
	in other brain regions.},

  abstract = {This overview covers recent advances in the field of EEG/MEG signal
	processing and modeling in epilepsy regarding both interictal and
	ictal phenomena. In the first part, the main methods used in the
	analysis of interictal EEG/MEG epileptiform spikes are presented
	and discussed. Source and volume conductor models are passed in review,
	namely the equivalent dipole source concept, the requirements for
	adequate time and spatial sampling, the question of how to validate
	source solutions, particularly by comparing solutions obtained using
	scalp and intracranial EEG signals, EEG & MEG data, or EEG simultaneously
	recorded with fMRI (BOLD signals). In the second part, methods used
	for the characterization of seizures are considered, namely dipolar
	modeling of spikes at seizure onset, decomposition of seizure EEG
	signals into sets of orthogonal spatio-temporal components, and also
	methods (linear and nonlinear) of estimating seizure propagation.
	In the third part, the crucial issue of how the transition between
	interictal and seizure activity takes place is examined. In particular
	the vicissitudes of the efforts along the road to seizure prediction
	are shortly reviewed. It is argued that this question can be reduced
	to the problem of estimating the excitability state of neuronal populations
	in the course of time as a seizure approaches. The value of active
	probing methods in contrast with passive analytical methods is emphasized.
	In the fourth part modeling aspects are considered in the light of
	two special kinds of epilepsies, absences characterized by spike-and-wave
	discharges and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. These two types correspond
	to different scenarios regarding the transition to epileptic seizures,
	namely the former is a case of a jump transition and the latter is
	a typical case of gradual transition. In conclusion, the necessity

  abstract = {In this overview, we consider epilepsies as dynamical diseases of
	brain systems since they are manifestations of the property of neuronal
	networks to display multistable dynamics. To illustrate this concept
	we may assume that at least two states of the epileptic brain are
	possible: the interictal state characterized by a normal, apparently
	random, steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) ongoing activity,
	and the ictal state, that is characterized by paroxysmal occurrence
	of synchronous oscillations and is generally called, in neurology,
	a seizure. The transition between these two states can either occur:
	1) as a continuous sequence of phases, like in some cases of mesial
	temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE); or 2) as a sudden leap, like in most
	cases of absence seizures. In the mathematical terminology of nonlinear
	systems, we can say that in the first case the system's attractor
	gradually deforms from an interictal to an ictal attractor. The causes
	for such a deformation can be either endogenous or external. In this
	type of ictal transition, the seizure possibly may be anticipated
	in its early, preclinical phases. In the second case, where a sharp
	critical transition takes place, we can assume that the system has
	at least two simultaneous interictal and ictal attractors all the
	time. To which attractor the trajectories converge, depends on the
	initial conditions and the system's parameters. An essential question
	in this scenario is how the transition between the normal ongoing
	and the seizure activity takes place. Such a transition can occur
	either due to the influence of external or endogenous factors or
	due to a random perturbation and, thus, it will be unpredictable.
	These dynamical changes may not be detectable from the analysis of
	the ongoing EEG, but they may be observable only by measuring the
	system's response to externally administered stimuli. In the special
	cases of reflex epilepsy, the leap between the normal ongoing attractor
	and the ictal attractor is caused by a well-defined external perturbation.
	Examples from these different scenarios are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {The occurrence of abnormal dynamics in a physiological system can
	become manifest as a sudden qualitative change in the behavior of
	characteristic physiologic variables. We assume that this is what
	happens in the brain with regard to epilepsy. We consider that neuronal
	networks involved in epilepsy possess multistable dynamics (i.e.,
	they may display several dynamic states). To illustrate this concept,
	we may assume, for simplicity, that at least two states are possible:
	an interictal one characterized by a normal, apparently random, steady-state
	of ongoing activity, and another one that is characterized by the
	paroxysmal occurrence of a synchronous oscillations (seizure).By
	using the terminology of the mathematics of nonlinear systems, we
	can say that such a bistable system has two attractors, to which
	the trajectories describing the system's output converge, depending
	on initial conditions and on the system's parameters. In phase-space,
	the basins of attraction corresponding to the two states are separated
	by what is called a "separatrix." We propose, schematically, that
	the transition between the normal ongoing and the seizure activity
	can take place according to three basic models: Model I: In certain
	epileptic brains (e.g., in absence seizures of idiopathic primary
	generalized epilepsies), the distance between "normal steady-state"
	and "paroxysmal" attractors is very small in contrast to that of
	a normal brain (possibly due to genetic and/or developmental factors).
	In the former, discrete random fluctuations of some variables can
	be sufficient for the occurrence of a transition to the paroxysmal
	state. In this case, such seizures are not predictable. Model II
	and model III: In other kinds of epileptic brains (e.g., limbic cortex
	epilepsies), the distance between "normal steady-state" and "paroxysmal"
	attractors is, in general, rather large, such that random fluctuations,
	of themselves, are commonly not capable of triggering a seizure.
	However, in these brains, neuronal networks have abnormal features
	characterized by unstable parameters that are very vulnerable to
	the influence of endogenous (model II) and/or exogenous (model III)
	factors. In these cases, these critical parameters may gradually
	change with time, in such a way that the attractor can deform either
	gradually or suddenly, with the consequence that the distance between
	the basin of attraction of the normal state and the separatrix tends
	to zero. This can lead, eventually, to a transition to a seizure.The
	changes of the system's dynamics preceding a seizure in these models
	either may be detectable in the EEG and thus the route to the seizure
	may be predictable, or may be unobservable by using only measurements
	of the dynamical state. It is thinkable, however, that in some cases,
	changes in the excitability state of the underlying networks may
	be uncovered by using appropriate stimuli configurations before changes
	in the dynamics of the ongoing EEG activity are evident. A typical
	example of model III that we discuss here is photosensitive epilepsy.We
	present an overview of these basic models, based on neurophysiologic
	recordings combined with signal analysis and on simulations performed
	by using computational models of neuronal networks. We pay especial
	attention to recent model studies and to novel experimental results
	obtained while analyzing EEG features preceding limbic seizures and
	during intermittent photic stimulation that precedes the transition

	MEG, as well as normal controls and non-photosensitive epileptic
	patients of the same age group. Spectral analysis of the MEG signals

	a second order response feature of the stimulus-triggered visual
	response preceding the PPR: the phase clustering index, which measures
	how close the phases of successive periods are grouped for each frequency
	component for all periods of the stimuli applied. We found that an
	enhancement of phase synchrony in the gamma-band (30-120Hz), harmonically
	related to the frequency of stimulation, preceded the stimulation
	trials that evolved into PPRs, and differed significantly from that
	encountered in trials not followed by PPR or in control subjects.

	(VSD) imaging which reports mesoscopic population activity at high

	square, a single flashed bar, the line-motion paradigm--for which
	psychophysical studies showed that flashing a square briefly before
	a bar produces sensation of illusory motion within the bar--and moving
	squares controls. We consider a two-layer neural field (NF) model
	describing an excitatory and an inhibitory layer of neurons as a
	coupled system of non-linear integro-differential equations. Under
	the assumption that the aggregated activity of both layers is reflected
	by VSD imaging, our phenomenological model quantitatively accounts
	for the observed spatio-temporal activity patterns. Moreover, the
	model generalizes to novel similar stimuli as it matches activity
	evoked by moving squares of different speeds. Our results indicate
	that feedback from higher brain areas is not required to produce
	motion patterns in the case of the illusory line-motion paradigm.
	Physiological interpretation of the model suggests that a considerable

	Propofol increases the maximal conductance and time constant of decay

	164 Alzheimer disease (AD) cases from 203 healthy control cases.
	Separate analyses were performed by using data from MR images obtained
	at one time point or by combining single-time-point measures with
	1-year change measures. Resulting discriminant functions were applied
	to 317 MCI cases to derive individual patient risk scores. Risk of
	conversion to AD was estimated as a continuous function of risk score
	percentile. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were computed for risk score
	quartiles. Odds ratios (ORs) for the conversion to AD were computed
	between the highest and lowest quartile scores.Individualized risk
	estimates from baseline MR examinations indicated that the 1-year
	risk of conversion to AD ranged from 3\% to 40\% (average group risk,
	17\%; OR, 7.2 for highest vs lowest score quartiles). Including measures
	of 1-year change in global and regional volumes significantly improved
	risk estimates (P = 001), with the risk of conversion to AD in the
	subsequent year ranging from 3\% to 69\% (average group risk, 27\%;
	OR, 12.0 for highest vs lowest score quartiles).Relative to the risk
	of conversion to AD conferred by the clinical diagnosis of MCI alone,
	MR imaging measures yield substantially more informative patient-specific
	risk estimates. Such predictive prognostic information will be critical
	if disease-modifying therapies become available.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101975/-/DC1.},

	methods based on hemodynamics to employ behavioral task paradigms
	typical of cognitive settings. However, the sluggishness of the hemodynamic
	response and its variance provide constraints on how ER-fMRI can
	be applied. In a series of two studies, estimates of the hemodynamic
	response in or near the primary visual and motor cortices were compared
	across various paradigms and sampling procedures to determine the
	limits of ER-fMRI procedures and, more generally, to describe the
	behavior of the hemodynamic response. The temporal profile of the
	hemodynamic response was estimated across overlapping events by solving
	a set of linear equations within the general linear model. No assumptions
	about the shape were made in solving the equations. Following estimation
	of the temporal profile, the amplitude and timing were modeled using
	a gamma function. Results indicated that (1) within a region, for
	a given subject, estimation of the hemodynamic response is extremely
	stable for both amplitude (r(2) = 0.98) and time to peak (r(2) =
	0.95), from one series of measurements to the next, and slightly
	less stable for estimation of time to onset (r(2) = 0.60). (2) As
	the trial presentation rate changed (from those spaced 20 s apart
	to temporally overlapping trials), the hemodynamic response amplitude
	showed a small, but significant, decrease. Trial onsets spaced (on
	average) 5 s apart showed a 17-25\% reduction in amplitude compared
	to those spaced 20 s apart. Power analysis indicated that the increased
	number of trials at fast rates outweighs this decrease in amplitude
	if statistically reliable response detection is the goal. (3) Knowledge
	of the amplitude and timing of the hemodynamic response in one region
	failed to predict those properties in another region, even for within-subject
	comparisons. (4) Across subjects, the amplitude of the response showed
	no significant correlation with timing of the response, for either
	time-to-onset or time-to-peak estimates. (5) The within-region stability
	of the response was sufficient to allow offsets in the timing of
	the response to be detected that were under a second, placing event-related
	fMRI methods in a position to answer questions about the change in
	relative timing between regions.},

	Phys. Rev. E 64, 011918 (2001)] and Bojak and Liley [I. Bojak and

	a new slow ionic mechanism is included in the main model. Generally,
	in mean-field models, some sigmoid-shape functions determine firing
	rates of neural populations according to their mean membrane potentials.
	In the enhanced model, the sigmoid function corresponding to excitatory
	population is redefined to be also a function of the slow ionic mechanism.
	This modification adapts the firing rate of neural populations to
	slow ionic activities of the brain. When an anesthetic drug is administered,
	the slow mechanism may induce neural cells to alternate between two
	levels of activity referred to as up and down states. Basically,
	the frequency of up-down switching is in the delta band (0-4 Hz)
	and this is the main reason behind high amplitude, low frequency
	fluctuations of EEG signals in anesthesia. Our analyses show that
	the enhanced model may have different working states driven by anesthetic
	drug concentration. The model is settled in the up state in the waking
	period, it may switch to up and down states in moderate anesthesia
	while in deep anesthesia it remains in the down state.},

(MEG) channel is well known for arbitrary frequencies omega but is
not directly applicable to MEG in the quasi-static approximation.
In this paper we derive an equation for omega = 0 starting from the
very definition of the lead field instead of using Helmholtz's reciprocity
theorems. The results are (a) the transpose of the conductivity times
the lead field is divergence-free, and (b) the lead field differs
from the one in any other volume conductor by a gradient of a scalar
function. Consequently, for a piecewise homogeneous and isotropic
volume conductor, the lead field is always tangential at the outermost
surface. Based on this theoretical result, we formulated a simple
and fast method for the MEG forward calculation for one shell of
arbitrary shape: we correct the corresponding lead field for a spherical
volume conductor by a superposition of basis functions, gradients
of harmonic functions constructed here from spherical harmonics,
with coefficients fitted to the boundary conditions. The algorithm
was tested for a prolate spheroid of realistic shape for which the
analytical solution is known. For high order in the expansion, we
found the solutions to be essentially exact and for reasonable accuracies
much fewer multiplications are needed than in typical implementations
of the boundary element methods. The generalization to more shells
is straightforward.},

	the head are believed due to postsynaptic potentials in vertically

	locations at any given time are due to the instantaneous difference
	in synaptic activity between the corresponding vertical regions.
	Because of the high correlation of activity between regions separated
	by distances large compared to the radius of influence of single
	neurons, communication between these locations must be by means of
	action potentials. In order to quantify the dynamics of interaction
	of 1010 cortical neurons, use is made of the concept of a neural
	mass. The neural mass consists of sufficiently large number of neurons
	so as to exhibit certain average properties which are independent
	of its exact inner circuitry. An integral wave equation is derived
	to describe the spatial-temporal variation of cortical potential.
	Solutions are obtained indicating that electrical oscillations, which
	are independent of the location and time history of subcortical input,
	can persist in the cortex. The nature of these oscillations depends
	on the relative abundance of excitatory and inhibitory connections
	between neural masses and on the physiological state of the brain.
	The latter is partially determined by velocity distribution functions
	for action potential propagation. A dispersion relation for brain
	waves is shown to exist for certain ranges of the connection parameters.
	In some limiting cases, weakly damped waves occur with ω=ck, where
	c refers to a characteristic velocity for the distribution functions.

  abstract = {Corticothalamic dynamics are investigated using a model in which spatial
	nonuniformities are incorporated via the coupling of spatial eigenmodes.
	Comparison of spectra generated using the nonuniform analysis with
	those generated using a uniform one demonstrates that, for most frequencies,
	local activity is only weakly dependent on activity elsewhere in
	the cortex; however, dispersion of low-wave-number activity ensures
	that distant dynamics influence local dynamics at low frequencies
	(below approximately 2 Hz ), and at the alpha frequency (approximately
	10 Hz ), where propagating signals are inherently weakly damped,
	and wavelengths are large. When certain model parameters have similar
	spatial profiles, as is expected from physiology, the low-frequency
	discrepancies tend to cancel, and the uniform analysis with local
	parameter values is an adequate approximation to the full nonuniform
	one across the whole spectrum, at least for large-scale nonuniformities.
	After comparing the uniform and nonuniform analyses, we consider
	one possible application of the nonuniform analysis: studying the
	phenomenon of occipital alpha dominance, whereby the alpha frequency
	and power are greater at the back of the head (occipitally) than
	at the front. In order to infer realistic nonuniformities in the
	model parameters, the uniform version of the model is first fitted
	to data recorded from 98 normal subjects in a waking, eyes-closed
	state. This yields a set of parameters at each of five electrode
	sites along the midline. The inferred parameter nonuniformities are
	consistent with anatomical and physiological constraints. Introducing
	these spatial profiles into the full nonuniform model then quantitatively
	reproduces observed site-dependent variations in the alpha power
	and frequency. The results confirm that the frequency shift is mainly
	due to a decrease in the corticothalamic propagation delay, but indicate
	that the delay nonuniformity cannot account for the observed occipital
	increase in alpha power; the occipital alpha dominance is due to
	decreased cortical gains and increased thalamic gains in occipital
	regions compared to frontal ones.},

  abstract = {The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal measured in the brain
	with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an activation
	experiment often exhibits pronounced transients at the beginning
	and end of the stimulus. Such transients could be a reflection of
	transients in the underlying neural activity, or they could result
	from transients in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic
	rate of oxygen (CMRO2), or cerebral blood volume (CBV). These transients
	were investigated using an arterial spin labeling (ASL) method that
	allows simultaneous measurements of BOLD and CBF responses. Responses
	to a finger-tapping task (40-s stimulus, 80-s rest) were measured
	in primary motor area (M1) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in
	five healthy volunteers. In SMA, the average BOLD response was pronounced
	near the beginning and end of the stimulus, while in M1, the BOLD
	response was nearly flat. However, CBF responses in the two regions
	were rather similar, and did not exhibit the same transient features
	as the BOLD response in SMA. Because this suggests a hemodynamic
	rather than a neural origin for the transients of the BOLD response
	in SMA, we used a generalization of the balloon model to test the
	degree of hemodynamic transients required to produce the measured
	curves. Both data sets could be approximated with modest differences
	in the shapes of the CMRO2 and CBV responses. This study illustrates
	the utility and the limitations of using theoretical models combined
	with ASL techniques to understand the dynamics of the BOLD response.},

	of brain water protons produced by the paramagnetic effects of venous

	vessels. The simulations suggest that the effect of water molecule
	diffusion is strong for the case of blood capillaries, but, for larger
	venous blood vessels, water diffusion is not an important determinant
	of deoxyhemoglobin-induced signal dephasing. We provide an expression

	We used International Consortium for Brain Mapping functional reference
	battery (FRB) fMRI data available from the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging
	image data archive. The selected data included measurements from
	37 right-handed subjects, who all had performed the same five tasks
	from FRB. The GLM was expected to locate activations accurately in

	between ISC and stimulus induced fMRI activation. The statistical
	maps of ISC and GLM were compared with two measures. The first measure
	was the Pearson's correlation between the non-thresholded ISC test-statistics
	and absolute values of the GLM Z-statistics. The average correlation
	value over five tasks was 0.74. The second was the Dice index between
	the activation regions of the methods. The average Dice value over
	the tasks and three threshold levels was 0.73. The results of this
	study indicated how the data driven ISC analysis found the same foci
	as the model-based GLM analysis. The agreement of the results is
	highly interesting, because ISC is applicable in situations where

	remain poorly understood. Studies in reduced systems--tissue cultures,
	acute slices, and anesthetized rats--show that spontaneous activity
	forms characteristic clusters in space and time, called neuronal
	avalanches. Modeling studies suggest that networks with this property
	are poised at a critical state that optimizes input processing, information
	storage, and transfer, but the relevance of avalanches for fully
	functional cerebral systems has been controversial. Here we show
	that ongoing cortical synchronization in awake rhesus monkeys carries
	the signature of neuronal avalanches. Negative LFP deflections (nLFPs)
	correlate with neuronal spiking and increase in amplitude with increases
	in local population spike rate and synchrony. These nLFPs form neuronal
	avalanches that are scale-invariant in space and time and with respect
	to the threshold of nLFP detection. This dimension, threshold invariance,
	describes a fractal organization: smaller nLFPs are embedded in clusters
	of larger ones without destroying the spatial and temporal scale-invariance
	of the dynamics. These findings suggest an organization of ongoing
	cortical synchronization that is scale-invariant in its three fundamental
	dimensions--time, space, and local neuronal group size. Such scale-invariance
	has ontogenetic and phylogenetic implications because it allows large
	increases in network capacity without a fundamental reorganization

	that are characteristic of real cortical microcircuits. This sparsity
	is modelled with radial connectivity functions or kernels with non-central

	responses to known exogenous input or random fluctuations. Here,
	we characterise the effect of different connectivity architectures
	(the range, dispersion and propagation speed of intrinsic or lateral
	connections) and synaptic gains on spatiotemporal dynamics. Specifically,
	we look at spectral responses to random fluctuations and examine
	the ability of synaptic gain and connectivity parameters to induce
	Turing instabilities. We find that although the spatial deployment
	and speed of lateral connections can have a profound affect on the
	behaviour of spatial modes over different scales, only synaptic gain
	is capable of producing phase-transitions. We discuss the implications
	of these findings for the use of neural fields as generative models
	in dynamic causal modeling (DCM).},

	model motivated by a well-known neural mass model; second, to show
	how one can estimate model parameters pertaining to spatial (anatomical)
	properties of neuronal sources based on EEG or LFP spectra using
	Bayesian inference. Specifically, we consider neural field models
	of cortical activity as generative models in the context of dynamic
	causal modeling (DCM). This paper considers the simplest case of
	a single cortical source modeled by the spatiotemporal dynamics of
	hidden neuronal states on a bounded cortical surface or manifold.
	We build this model using multiple layers, corresponding to cortical
	lamina in the real cortical manifold. These layers correspond to
	the populations considered in classical (Jansen and Rit) neural mass
	models. This allows us to formulate a neural field model that can
	be reduced to a neural mass model using appropriate constraints on
	its spatial parameters. In turn, this enables one to compare and
	contrast the predicted responses from equivalent neural field and
	mass models respectively. We pursue this using empirical LFP data
	from a single electrode to show that the parameters controlling the
	spatial dynamics of cortical activity can be recovered, using DCM,

	models of the Amari type. We consider the application of these models
	to non-invasive data, with a special focus on the mapping from source
	activity on the cortical surface to a single channel. We introduce
	a neural field model based upon the canonical microcircuit (CMC),
	in which neuronal populations are assigned to different cortical
	layers. We show that DCM can disambiguate between alternative (neural
	mass and field) models of cortical activity. However, unlike neural
	mass models, DCM with neural fields can address questions about neuronal
	microcircuitry and lateral interactions. This is because they are
	equipped with interlaminar connections and horizontal intra-laminar
	connections that are patchy in nature. These horizontal or lateral
	connections can be regarded as connecting macrocolumns with similar
	feature selectivity. Crucially, the spatial parameters governing
	horizontal connectivity determine the separation (width) of cortical
	macrocolumns. Thus we can estimate the width of macro columns, using
	non-invasive electromagnetic signals. We illustrate this estimation
	using dynamic causal models of steady-state or ongoing spectral activity
	measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in human visual cortex.
	Specifically, we revisit the hypothesis that the size of a macrocolumn
	is a key determinant of neuronal dynamics, particularly the peak
	gamma frequency. We are able to show a correlation, over subjects,
	between columnar size and peak gamma frequency - that fits comfortably
	with established correlations between peak gamma frequency and the
	size of visual cortex defined retinotopically. We also considered
	cortical excitability and assessed its relative influence on observed
	gamma activity. This example highlights the potential utility of
	dynamic causal modelling and neural fields in providing quantitative
	characterisations of spatially extended dynamics on the cortical
	surface - that are parameterised in terms of horizontal connections,
	implicit in the cortical micro-architecture and its synaptic parameters.},

  abstract = {The cortex is spontaneously active, even in the absence of any particular
	input or motor output. During development, this activity is important
	for the migration and differentiation of cortex cell types and the
	formation of neuronal connections. In the mature animal, ongoing
	activity reflects the past and the present state of an animal into
	which sensory stimuli are seamlessly integrated to compute future
	actions. Thus, a clear understanding of the organization of ongoing
	i.e. spontaneous activity is a prerequisite to understand cortex
	function. Numerous recording techniques revealed that ongoing activity
	in cortex is comprised of many neurons whose individual activities
	transiently sum to larger events that can be detected in the local
	field potential (LFP) with extracellular microelectrodes, or in the
	electroencephalogram (EEG), the magnetoencephalogram (MEG), and the
	BOLD signal from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The
	LFP is currently the method of choice when studying neuronal population
	activity with high temporal and spatial resolution at the mesoscopic
	scale (several thousands of neurons). At the extracellular microelectrode,
	locally synchronized activities of spatially neighbored neurons result
	in rapid deflections in the LFP up to several hundreds of microvolts.
	When using an array of microelectrodes, the organizations of such
	deflections can be conveniently monitored in space and time. Neuronal
	avalanches describe the scale-invariant spatiotemporal organization
	of ongoing neuronal activity in the brain. They are specific to the
	superficial layers of cortex as established in vitro, in vivo in
	the anesthetized rat, and in the awake monkey. Importantly, both
	theoretical and empirical studies suggest that neuronal avalanches
	indicate an exquisitely balanced critical state dynamics of cortex
	that optimizes information transfer and information processing. In
	order to study the mechanisms of neuronal avalanche development,
	maintenance, and regulation, in vitro preparations are highly beneficial,
	as they allow for stable recordings of avalanche activity under precisely
	controlled conditions. The current protocol describes how to study
	neuronal avalanches in vitro by taking advantage of superficial layer
	development in organotypic cortex cultures, i.e. slice cultures,
	grown on planar, integrated microelectrode arrays (MEA).},

	segregate and integrate information while performing high cognitive
	functions is a subject of imminent future consequences. The most
	significant contributions to date in this field, known as cognitive
	neuroscience, have been achieved by using innovative neuroimaging
	techniques, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI), which measure variations in both the time
	and the space of some interpretable physical magnitudes. Extraordinary
	maps of cerebral activation involving function-restricted brain areas,
	as well as graphs of the functional connectivity between them, have
	been obtained from EEG and fMRI data by solving some spatio-temporal
	inverse problems, which constitutes a top-down approach. However,
	in many cases, a natural bridge between these maps/graphs and the
	causal physiological processes is lacking, leading to some misunderstandings
	in their interpretation. Recent advances in the comprehension of
	the underlying physiological mechanisms associated with different
	cerebral scales have provided researchers with an excellent scenario
	to develop sophisticated biophysical models that permit an integration
	of these neuroimage modalities, which must share a common aetiology.
	This paper proposes a bottom-up approach, involving physiological
	parameters in a specific mesoscopic dynamic equations system. Further
	observation equations encapsulating the relationship between the
	mesostates and the EEG/fMRI data are obtained on the basis of the
	physical foundations of these techniques. A methodology for the estimation
	of parameters from fused EEG/fMRI data is also presented. In this
	context, the concepts of activation and effective connectivity are
	carefully revised. This new approach permits us to examine and discuss
	some future prospects for the integration of multimodal neuroimages.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new procedure is presented which allows the estimation
	of the states and parameters of the hemodynamic approach from blood
	oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses. The proposed method
	constitutes an alternative to the recently proposed Friston [NeuroImage
	16 (2002) 513] method and has some advantages over it. The procedure
	is based on recent groundbreaking time series analysis techniques
	that have been, in this case, adopted to characterize hemodynamic
	responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This work
	represents a fundamental improvement over existing approaches to
	system identification using nonlinear hemodynamic models and is important
	for three reasons. First, our model includes physiological noise.
	Previous models have been based upon ordinary differential equations
	that only allow for noise or error to enter at the level of observation.
	Secondly, by using the innovation method and the local linearization
	filter, not only the parameters, but also the underlying states of
	the system generating responses can be estimated. These states can
	include things like a flow-inducing signal triggered by neuronal
	activation, de-oxyhemoglobine, cerebral blood flow and volume. Finally,
	radial basis functions have been introduced as a parametric model
	to represent arbitrary temporal input sequences in the hemodynamic
	approach, which could be essential to understanding those brain areas
	indirectly related to the stimulus. Hence, thirdly, by inferring
	about the radial basis parameters, we are able to perform a blind
	deconvolution, which permits both the reconstruction of the dynamics
	of the most likely hemodynamic states and also, to implicitly reconstruct
	the underlying synaptic dynamics, induced experimentally, which caused
	these states variations. From this study, we conclude that in spite
	of the utility of the standard discrete convolution approach used
	in statistical parametric maps (SPM), nonlinear BOLD phenomena and
	unspecific input temporal sequences must be included in the fMRI
	analysis.},

  abstract = {A quantitative theory is developed for the relationship between stimulus
	and the resulting blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional
	MRI signal. The relationship of stimuli to neuronal activity during
	evoked responses is inferred from recent physiology-based quantitative
	modeling of evoked response potentials (ERPs). A hemodynamic model
	is then used to calculate the BOLD response to neuronal activity
	having the form of an impulse, a sinusoid, or an ERP-like damped
	sinusoid. Using the resulting equations, the BOLD response is analyzed
	for different forms, frequencies, and amplitudes of stimuli, in contrast
	with previous research, which has mostly concentrated on sustained
	stimuli. The BOLD frequency response is found to be closely linear
	in the parameter ranges of interest, with the form of a low-pass
	filter with a weak resonance at approximately 0.07 Hz. An improved
	BOLD impulse response is systematically obtained which includes initial
	dip and post-stimulus undershoot for some parameter ranges. It is
	found that the BOLD response depends strongly on the precise temporal
	course of the evoked neuronal activity, not just its peak value or
	typical amplitude. Indeed, for short stimuli, the linear BOLD response
	is closely proportional to the time-integrated activity change evoked
	by the stimulus, regardless of amplitude. It is concluded that there
	can be widely differing proportionalities between BOLD and peak activity,
	that this is the likely reason for the low level of correspondence
	seen experimentally between ERP sources and BOLD measurements and
	that non-BOLD measurements, such as ERPs, can be used to correct
	for this effect to obtain improved activity estimates. Finally, stimulus
	sequences that optimize the signal-to-noise ratio in event-related
	BOLD fMRI (efMRI) experiments are derived using the hemodynamic transfer
	function.},

	the means to interpret its function. Using two large study groups
	with different resting state conditions and MR protocols, the reproducibility
	of the network across subjects, behavioural conditions and acquisition
	parameters is assessed. Independent Component Analysis (ICA), combined
	with novel analyses of temporal features, is applied to establish
	the basis of signal fluctuations in the network and its relation
	to other RSNs. Reference to prior probabilistic diffusion tractography
	work is used to identify the basal ganglia circuit to which these
	fluctuations correspond.An RSN is identified in the basal ganglia
	and thalamus, comprising the pallidum, putamen, subthalamic nucleus
	and substantia nigra, with a projection also to the supplementary

	probabilities allow this network to be identified as the motor control

	field strength and echo-planar imaging parameters. It shows a frequency
	peak at 0.025 +/- 0.007 Hz and is most similar in spectral composition

	Fluctuations in this RSN are correlated with those in the task-positive

  abstract = {We propose Granger causality mapping (GCM) as an approach to explore
	directed influences between neuronal populations (effective connectivity)
	in fMRI data. The method does not rely on a priori specification
	of a model that contains pre-selected regions and connections between
	them. This distinguishes it from other fMRI effective connectivity
	approaches that aim at testing or contrasting specific hypotheses
	about neuronal interactions. Instead, GCM relies on the concept of
	Granger causality to define the existence and direction of influence
	from information in the data. Temporal precedence information is
	exploited to compute Granger causality maps that identify voxels
	that are sources or targets of directed influence for any selected
	region-of-interest. We investigated the method by simulations and
	by application to fMRI data of a complex visuomotor task. The presented
	exploratory approach of mapping influences between a region of interest
	and the rest of the brain can form a useful complement to existing
	models of effective connectivity.},

  abstract = {The optic chiasm with its complex fiber micro-structure is a challenge
	for diffusion tensor models and tractography methods. Likewise, it
	is an ideal candidate for evaluation of diffusion tensor imaging
	tractography approaches in resolving inter-regional connectivity
	because the macroscopic connectivity of the optic chiasm is well
	known. Here, high-resolution (156 microm in-plane) diffusion tensor
	imaging of the human optic chiasm was performed ex vivo at ultra-high
	field (9.4 T). Estimated diffusion tensors at this high resolution
	were able to capture complex fiber configurations such as sharp curves,
	and convergence and divergence of tracts, but were unable to resolve
	directions at sites of crossing fibers. Despite the complex microstructure
	of the fiber paths through the optic chiasm, all known connections
	could be tracked by a line propagation algorithm. However, fibers
	crossing from the optic nerve to the contralateral tract were heavily
	underrepresented, whereas ipsilateral nerve-to-tract connections,
	as well as tract-to-tract connections, were overrepresented, and
	erroneous nerve-to-nerve connections were tracked. The effects of
	spatial resolution and the varying degrees of partial volume averaging
	of complex fiber architecture on the performance of these methods
	could be investigated. Errors made by the tractography algorithm
	at high resolution were shown to increase at lower resolutions closer
	to those used in vivo. This study shows that increases in resolution,
	made possible by higher field strengths, improve the accuracy of
	DTI-based tractography. More generally, post-mortem investigation
	of fixed tissue samples with diffusion imaging at high field strengths
	is important in the evaluation of MR-based diffusion models and tractography
	algorithms.},

	A recent study using in situ perfused rat brain preparations demonstrated
	a reorganization of the respiratory pattern with sequential reduction
	of the brain stem respiratory network. Specifically, with removal
	of the pons, the normal three-phase pattern transformed to a two-phase
	inspiratory-expiratory pattern and, with more caudal transections,
	to one-phase, intrinsically generated inspiratory oscillations. A
	minimal neural network proposed to reproduce these transformations
	includes 1) a ringlike mutually inhibitory network composed of the
	postinspiratory, augmenting expiratory, and early-inspiratory neurons
	and 2) an excitatory preinspiratory neuron, with persistent sodium
	current (I(NaP))-dependent intrinsic bursting properties, that dynamically
	participates in the expiratory-inspiratory phase transition and inspiratory
	phase generation. We used activity-based single-neuron models and
	applied numerical simulations, bifurcation methods, and fast-slow
	decomposition to describe the behavior of this network in the functional
	states corresponding to the three-, two-, and one-phase oscillatory
	regimes, as well as to analyze the transitions between states and
	between respiratory phases within each state. We demonstrate that,
	although I(NaP) is not necessary for the generation of three- and
	two-phase oscillations, it contributes to control of the oscillation
	period in each state. We also show that the transitions between states
	can be produced by progressive changes of drives to particular neurons
	and proceed through intermediate regimes, featuring high-amplitude
	late-expiratory and biphasic-expiratory activities or ectopic burst

	on structural connectivity networks, using coupled nonlinear maps.
	On slow time scales structural connectivity is gradually adjusted
	towards the resulting functional patterns via an unsupervised, activity-dependent
	rewiring rule. The present model has been previously shown to generate
	cortical-like, modular small-world structural topology from initially
	random connectivity. We provide further biophysical justification
	for this model and quantitatively characterize the relationship between
	structure, function and dynamics that accompanies the ensuing self-organization.We
	show that coupled chaotic dynamics generate ordered and modular functional
	patterns, even on a random underlying structural connectivity. Consequently,
	structural connectivity becomes more modular as it rewires towards
	these functional patterns. Functional networks reflect the underlying
	structural networks on slow time scales, but significantly less so
	on faster time scales. In spite of ordered functional topology, structural
	networks remain robustly interconnected--and therefore small-world--due
	to the presence of central, inter-modular hub nodes. The noisy dynamics
	of these hubs enable them to persist despite ongoing rewiring and
	despite their comparative absence in functional networks.Our results
	outline a theoretical mechanism by which brain dynamics may facilitate
	neuroanatomical self-organization. We find time scale dependent differences

	studies. Despite this, the neurobiological determinants of these
	dynamics have not been previously sought. Here, we systematically
	examined the influence of such determinants in hierarchically modular
	networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-timing-dependent
	synaptic plasticity and axonal conduction delays. We characterized
	emergent dynamics in our networks by distributions of active neuronal
	ensemble modules (neuronal avalanches) and rigorously assessed these
	distributions for power-law scaling. We found that spike-timing-dependent
	synaptic plasticity enabled a rapid phase transition from random
	subcritical dynamics to ordered supercritical dynamics. Importantly,
	modular connectivity and low wiring cost broadened this transition,
	and enabled a regime indicative of self-organized criticality. The
	regime only occurred when modular connectivity, low wiring cost and
	synaptic plasticity were simultaneously present, and the regime was
	most evident when between-module connection density scaled as a power-law.
	The regime was robust to variations in other neurobiologically relevant
	parameters and favored systems with low external drive and strong
	internal interactions. Increases in system size and connectivity
	facilitated internal interactions, permitting reductions in external
	drive and facilitating convergence of postsynaptic-response magnitude
	and synaptic-plasticity learning rate parameter values towards neurobiologically
	realistic levels. We hence infer a novel association between self-organized
	critical neuronal dynamics and several neurobiologically realistic
	features of structural connectivity. The central role of these features

	article, the surface area is employed as a morphometric descriptor
	to study the concurrent changes between brain structures and to build
	binarized connectivity graphs. The statistical similarity in surface
	area between pair of regions was measured by computing the partial
	correlation coefficient across 186 normal subjects of the Cuban Human
	Brain Mapping Project. We demonstrated that connectivity matrices
	obtained follow a small-world behavior for two different parcellations
	of the brain gray matter. The properties of the connectivity matrices
	were compared to the matrices obtained using the mean cortical thickness
	for the same cortical parcellations. The topology of the cortical
	thickness and surface area networks were statistically different,
	demonstrating that both capture distinct properties of the interaction
	or different aspects of the same interaction (mechanical, anatomical,
	chemical, etc.) between brain structures. This finding could be explained
	by the fact that each descriptor is driven by distinct cellular mechanisms
	as result of a distinct genetic origin. To our knowledge, this is
	the first time that surface area is used to study the morphological

	This simulation environment enables the model-based inference of

	facilitates an exploration of the consequences of pathological changes
	in the system, permitting to investigate potential ways to counteract
	such unfavorable processes. The architecture of TVB supports interaction
	with MATLAB packages, for example, the well known Brain Connectivity
	Toolbox. TVB can be used in a client-server configuration, such that
	it can be remotely accessed through the Internet thanks to its web-based
	HTML5, JS, and WebGL graphical user interface. TVB is also accessible
	as a standalone cross-platform Python library and application, and
	users can interact with the scientific core through the scripting

	of the scientific kernel. This second interface makes TVB extensible
	by combining it with other libraries and modules developed by the

	With sensitivity and specificity rates of approximately 80\%, we

	(FA) thresholds for the tractography and identified FA values between
	0.02 and 0.08 as optimal in our study. Last, we validated the course

	project. Pairs of raters were assigned to each structure and trained
	on the protocol for that structure. Each rater pair was tested for
	concordance on 6 of the 40 brains; once they had achieved reliability
	standards, they divided the task of delineating the remaining 34
	brains. The data were then spatially normalized to well-known templates
	using 3 popular algorithms: AIR5.2.5's nonlinear warp (Woods et al.,
	1998) paired with the ICBM452 Warp 5 atlas (Rex et al., 2003), FSL's
	FLIRT (Smith et al., 2004) was paired with its own template, a skull-stripped
	version of the ICBM152 T1 average; and SPM5's unified segmentation
	method (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) was paired with its canonical
	brain, the whole head ICBM152 T1 average. We thus produced 3 variants
	of our atlas, where each was constructed from 40 representative samples
	of a data processing stream that one might use for analysis. For
	each normalization algorithm, the individual structure delineations
	were then resampled according to the computed transformations. We
	next computed averages at each voxel location to estimate the probability

	each region, thus providing a resource for automated probabilistic
	labeling of external data types registered into standard spaces;
	we also computed average intensity images and tissue density maps
	based on the three methods and target spaces. These atlases will

	Neuronal avalanches are a type of spontaneous activity observed in

	predicts that criticality and, therefore, neuronal avalanches are

	changing the ratio of excitation and inhibition in the cultures,

	level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) signals in gray matter,
	excluding the confounding, inaccurate contributions of large blood
	vessels. We quantified the spatial specificity of the BOLD response,
	and we investigated whether this specificity varies as a function
	of time from stimulus onset. fMRI was performed at 7 Tesla (T), where
	mapping signals of parenchymal origin are easily detected. Two abutting
	visual stimuli were adjusted to elicit responses centered on a flat
	gray matter region in V1. fMRI signals were sampled at high-resolution
	orthogonal to the retinotopic boundary between the representations
	of the stimuli. Signals from macro-vessels were masked out. Principal
	component analysis revealed that the first component in space accounted
	for 96.2+/-1.6\% of the variance over time. The spatial profile of
	this time-invariant response was fitted with a model consisting of
	the convolution of a step function and a Gaussian point-spread-function
	(PSF). The mean full-width at half-maximal-height of the fitted PSF
	was 2.34+/-0.20 mm. Based on simulations of confounding effects,
	we estimate that BOLD PSF in human gray matter is smaller than 2
	mm. A time-point to time-point analysis revealed that the PSF obtained
	during the 3rd (1.52 mm) and 4th (1.99 mm) seconds of stimulation
	were narrower than the mean PSF obtained from the 5th second on (2.42+/-0.15
	mm). The position of the edge of the responding region was offset
	(1.72+/-0.07 mm) from the boundary of the stimulated region, indicating
	a spatial non-linearity. Simulations showed that the effective contrast
	between active and non-active columns is reduced 25-fold when imaged
	using a PSF whose width is equal to the cycle of the imaged columnar
	organization. Thus, the PSF of the hyper-oxygenated BOLD response
	in human gray matter is narrower than that reported at 1.5 T, where
	macro-vessels dominate the mapping signals. The initial phase of
	this response is more spatially specific than later phases. Data
	acquisition methods that suppress macro-vascular signals should increase
	the spatial specificity of BOLD fMRI. The choice of optimal stimulus
	duration represents a trade-off between the spatial specificity and
	the overhead associated with short stimulus duration.},

	is targeted at programmers who have experience in coding yet are
	new to coding for OpenGL applications. The opening chapters go into
	descriptive detail of how OpenGL, the software interface for hardware
	3-D chipsets, works and what you can expect from it, which turns
	out to be much more than you might have thought. Color plates are
	used, for example, to show how OpenGL handles such effects as motion
	blur and depth-of-field blur, in addition to shadows and texture
	mapping.<p> This is not a beginner's guide to programming computer
	graphics. Some previous knowledge of both programming in general
	and computer graphics in particular is required. For example, code
	snippets are used to describe how to implement these effects, but
	because OpenGL is platform-independent, some code examples may need
	to be modified when used with your specific compiler.<p> Filled with
	the expertise of those who standardized OpenGL, there is no better
	reference volume for learning and understanding this system. The
	examples cited are clear, commented, and explained. The only drawback
	to the book is that it lacks a companion CD-ROM--all examples must
	be either typed in or downloaded from an Internet FTP site. (The

	Level Dependent (BOLD) images to brain temperature maps, based on
	the idea that disproportional local changes in cerebral blood flow
	(CBF) as compared with cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption

	changes and the BOLD effect. Using an oxygen limitation model and
	a BOLD signal model, we obtain a transcendental equation relating
	CBF and CMRO₂ changes with the corresponding BOLD signal, which is
	solved in terms of the Lambert W function. Inserting this result
	in the dynamic bioheat equation describing the rate of temperature
	changes in the brain, we obtain a nonautonomous ordinary differential
	equation that depends on the BOLD response, which is solved numerically
	for each brain voxel. Temperature maps obtained from a real BOLD
	dataset registered in an attention to visual motion experiment were
	calculated, obtaining temperature variations in the range: (-0.15,
	0.1) which is consistent with experimental results. The statistical
	analysis revealed that significant temperature activations have a
	similar distribution pattern than BOLD activations. An interesting
	difference was the activation of the precuneus in temperature maps,
	a region involved in visuospatial processing, an effect that was
	not observed on BOLD maps. Furthermore, temperature maps were more
	localized to gray matter regions than the original BOLD maps, showing

	BOLD signals and neuronal activity, and a neural mass model describing
	the neuronal dynamics within a voxel and its interactions with voxels
	of the same area (short-range interactions) and other areas (long-range

	the BOLD model, the number of active synapses within the voxel, that
	is, the average number of synapses that will receive an action potential
	within the time unit. This is obtained by considering the action
	potentials transmitted between neuronal populations within the voxel,

	We reproduced the entrainment phenomenon observed in EEG during a

	chaos, for biologically plausible parameter ranges. We chart the
	entire parameter space by means of characteristic Lyapunov spectra
	and Kaplan-Yorke dimension as well as time series and power spectra.
	Rhythmic and chaotic brain states were found virtually next to each
	other, such that small parameter changes can give rise to switching
	from one to another. Strikingly, this characteristic pattern of unpredictability
	generated by the model was matched to the experimental data with
	reasonable accuracy. These findings confirm that the NMM is a useful
	model of brain dynamics during photic driving. In this context, it
	can be used to study the mechanisms of, for example, perception and

	in providing a biophysically plausible framework for explaining different

	in the hemodynamic forward model for dynamic causal modeling (DCM)
	of fMRI data. A recent study by Obata et al. [Obata, T., Liu, T.T.,

	In this paper, we show that the classical and revised models are
	special cases of a generalized model. The BOLD signal equation of
	this generalized model can be reduced to that of the classical Buxton

	by embedding different variants of the BOLD signal equation in a
	well-established DCM of functional interactions among visual areas.
	This allows us to compare the ensuing models using Bayesian model
	selection. Our model comparison approach had a factorial structure,
	comparing eight different hemodynamic models based on (i) classical

  abstract = {We present a model for the dynamics of a cerebral cortex in which
	inputs to neuronal assemblies are treated as random Gaussian fluctuations
	about a mean value. We incorporate the effect of general anesthetic
	agents on the cortex as a modulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter
	rate constant. Stochastic differential equations are derived for
	the state variable h(e), the average excitatory soma potential, coherent
	fluctuations of which are believed to be the source of scalp-measured
	electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Using this stochastic approach
	we derive a stationary (long-time limit) fluctuation spectrum for
	h(e). The model predicts that there will be three distinct stationary
	(equilibrium) regimes for cortical activity. In region I ("coma"),
	corresponding to a strong inhibitory anesthetic effect, h(e) is single
	valued, large, and negative, so that neuronal firing rates are suppressed.
	In region II for a zero or small anesthetic effect, h(e) can take
	on three values, two of which are stable; we label the stable solutions
	as "active" (enhanced firing) and "quiescent" (suppressed firing).
	For region III, corresponding to negative anesthetic (i.e., analeptic)
	effect, h(e) again becomes single valued, but is now small and negative,
	resulting in strongly elevated firing rates ("seizure"). If we identify
	region II as associated with the conscious state of the cortex, then
	the model predicts that there will be a rapid transit between the
	active-conscious and comatose unconscious states at a critical value
	of anesthetic concentration, suggesting the existence of phase transitions
	in the cortex. The low-frequency spectral power in the h(e) signal
	should increase strongly during the initial stage of anesthesia induction,
	before collapsing to much lower values after the transition into
	comatose-unconsciousness. These qualitative predictions are consistent
	with clinical measurements by Bührer et al. [Anaesthesiology 77,
	226 (1992)], MacIver et al. [ibid. 84, 1411 (1996)], and Kuizenga
	et al. [Br. J. Anaesthesia 80, 725 (1998)]. This strong increase
	in EEG spectral power in the vicinity of the critical point is similar
	to the divergences observed during thermodynamic phase transitions.
	We show that the divergence in low-frequency power in our model is
	a natural consequence of the existence of turning points in the trajectory

	new permutation operator specifically meant for the FMM parameter
	estimation. In addition to improving the optimization results, the
	permutation operator allows for imposing biologically meaningful
	constraints to the FMM parameter values. We also introduce a hybrid
	of the genetic algorithm and the EM algorithm for efficient solution
	of multidimensional FMM fitting problems. We compare our algorithm
	to the self-annealing EM-algorithm and a standard real coded genetic
	algorithm with the voxel classification tasks within the brain imaging.
	The algorithms are tested on synthetic data as well as real three-dimensional

	such a procedure does not necessarily mean that the system exhibits
	self-organized criticality. We first provide an analysis of multisite
	local field potential (LFP) recordings of brain activity and show
	that event size distributions defined as negative LFP peaks can be
	close to power-law distributions. However, this result is not robust
	to change in detection threshold, or when tested using more rigorous
	statistical analyses such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Similar
	power-law scaling is observed for surrogate signals, suggesting that
	power-law scaling may be a generic property of thresholded stochastic
	processes. We next investigate this problem analytically, and show
	that, indeed, stochastic processes can produce spurious power-law
	scaling without the presence of underlying self-organized criticality.
	However, this power-law is only apparent in logarithmic representations,
	and does not survive more rigorous analysis such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
	test. The same analysis was also performed on an artificial network
	known to display self-organized criticality. In this case, both the
	graphical representations and the rigorous statistical analysis reveal
	with no ambiguity that the avalanche size is distributed as a power-law.
	We conclude that logarithmic representations can lead to spurious
	power-law scaling induced by the stochastic nature of the phenomenon.
	This apparent power-law scaling does not constitute a proof of self-organized

  abstract = {This article reviews progress and challenges in model driven EEG/fMRI
	fusion with a focus on brain oscillations. Fusion is the combination
	of both imaging modalities based on a cascade of forward models from
	ensemble of post-synaptic potentials (ePSP) to net primary current
	densities (nPCD) to EEG; and from ePSP to vasomotor feed forward
	signal (VFFSS) to BOLD. In absence of a model, data driven fusion
	creates maps of correlations between EEG and BOLD or between estimates
	of nPCD and VFFS. A consistent finding has been that of positive
	correlations between EEG alpha power and BOLD in both frontal cortices
	and thalamus and of negative ones for the occipital region. For model
	driven fusion we formulate a neural mass EEG/fMRI model coupled to
	a metabolic hemodynamic model. For exploratory simulations we show
	that the Local Linearization (LL) method for integrating stochastic
	differential equations is appropriate for highly nonlinear dynamics.
	It has been successfully applied to small and medium sized networks,
	reproducing the described EEG/BOLD correlations. A new LL-algebraic
	method allows simulations with hundreds of thousands of neural populations,
	with connectivities and conduction delays estimated from diffusion
	weighted MRI. For parameter and state estimation, Kalman filtering
	combined with the LL method estimates the innovations or prediction
	errors. From these the likelihood of models given data are obtained.
	The LL-innovation estimation method has been already applied to small
	and medium scale models. With improved Bayesian computations the
	practical estimation of very large scale EEG/fMRI models shall soon
	be possible.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, several papers have focused on the construction
	of highly detailed mouse high field magnetic resonance image (MRI)
	templates via non-linear registration to unbiased reference spaces,
	allowing for a variety of neuroimaging applications such as robust
	morphometric analyses. However, work in rats has only provided medium
	field MRI averages based on linear registration to biased spaces
	with the sole purpose of approximate functional MRI (fMRI) localization.
	This precludes any morphometric analysis in spite of the need of
	exploring in detail the neuroanatomical substrates of diseases in
	a recent advent of rat models. In this paper we present a new in
	vivo rat T2 MRI template set, comprising average images of both intensity
	and shape, obtained via non-linear registration. Also, unlike previous
	rat template sets, we include white and gray matter probabilistic
	segmentations, expanding its use to those applications demanding
	prior-based tissue segmentation, e.g., statistical parametric mapping
	(SPM) voxel-based morphometry. We also provide a preliminary digitalization
	of latest Paxinos and Watson atlas for anatomical and functional
	interpretations within the cerebral cortex. We confirmed that, like
	with previous templates, forepaw and hindpaw fMRI activations can
	be correctly localized in the expected atlas structure. To exemplify
	the use of our new MRI template set, were reported the volumes of
	brain tissues and cortical structures and probed their relationships
	with ontogenetic development. Other in vivo applications in the near
	future can be tensor-, deformation-, or voxel-based morphometry,
	morphological connectivity, and diffusion tensor-based anatomical
	connectivity. Our template set, freely available through the SPM
	extension website, could be an important tool for future longitudinal
	and/or functional extensive preclinical studies.},

  abstract = {Higher brain function depends on task-dependent information flow between
	cortical regions. Converging lines of evidence suggest that interactions
	between cortical regions and the central thalamus play a key role
	in establishing the dynamic patterns of functional connectivity that
	normally support these processes. In patients with chronic disturbances
	of cognitive function due to severe brain injury, dysfunction of
	this circuitry likely plays a crucial role in pathogenesis. However,
	assaying thalamocortical interactions is challenging even in healthy
	subjects and more so in severely impaired patients. To approach this
	problem, we apply a dynamical-systems approach to motivate an analysis
	of the electroencephalogram (EEG). We begin with a model for a single
	thalamocortical module [Robinson PA, Rennie CJ, Rowe DL (2002) Phys
	Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys 65:041924; Robinson PA, Rennie
	CJ, Wright JJ, Bourke PD (1998) Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter
	Phys 58:3557-3571]. When two such modules interact via shared thalamic
	inhibition, multistable behavior emerges; each mode is characterized
	by a different pattern of coherence between cortical regions. This
	observation suggests that changing patterns of cortical coherence
	are a hallmark of normal thalamocortical dynamics. In a preliminary
	study, we test this idea by analyzing the EEG of a patient with chronic
	brain injury, who has a marked improvement in behavior and frontal
	brain metabolism in response to zolpidem. The analysis shows that
	following zolpidem administration, changing patterns of coherence
	are identified between the frontal lobes and between frontal and
	distant brain regions. These observations support the role of the
	central thalamus in the organization of patterns of cortical interactions
	and suggest how indexes of thalamocortical dynamics can be extracted
	from the EEG.},

  year = {2011},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {30},
  abstract = {Cerebral cortical brain networks possess a number of conspicuous features
	of structure and dynamics. First, these networks have an intricate,
	non-random organization. In particular, they are structured in a
	hierarchical modular fashion, from large-scale regions of the whole
	brain, via cortical areas and area subcompartments organized as structural
	and functional maps to cortical columns, and finally circuits made
	up of individual neurons. Second, the networks display self-organized
	sustained activity, which is persistent in the absence of external
	stimuli. At the systems level, such activity is characterized by
	complex rhythmical oscillations over a broadband background, while
	at the cellular level, neuronal discharges have been observed to
	display avalanches, indicating that cortical networks are at the
	state of self-organized criticality (SOC). We explored the relationship
	between hierarchical neural network organization and sustained dynamics
	using large-scale network modeling. Previously, it was shown that
	sparse random networks with balanced excitation and inhibition can
	sustain neural activity without external stimulation. We found that
	a hierarchical modular architecture can generate sustained activity
	better than random networks. Moreover, the system can simultaneously
	support rhythmical oscillations and SOC, which are not present in
	the respective random networks. The mechanism underlying the sustained
	activity is that each dense module cannot sustain activity on its
	own, but displays SOC in the presence of weak perturbations. Therefore,
	the hierarchical modular networks provide the coupling among subsystems
	with SOC. These results imply that the hierarchical modular architecture
	of cortical networks plays an important role in shaping the ongoing
	spontaneous activity of the brain, potentially allowing the system
	to take advantage of both the sensitivity of critical states and
	the predictability and timing of oscillations for efficient information
	processing.},

  abstract = {Functional connectomics is one of the most rapidly expanding areas
	of neuroimaging research. Yet, concerns remain regarding the use
	of resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) to characterize inter-individual variation
	in the functional connectome. In particular, recent findings that
	"micro" head movements can introduce artifactual inter-individual
	and group-related differences in R-fMRI metrics have raised concerns.
	Here, we first build on prior demonstrations of regional variation
	in the magnitude of framewise displacements associated with a given
	head movement, by providing a comprehensive voxel-based examination
	of the impact of motion on the BOLD signal (i.e., motion-BOLD relationships).
	Positive motion-BOLD relationships were detected in primary and supplementary
	motor areas, particularly in low motion datasets. Negative motion-BOLD
	relationships were most prominent in prefrontal regions, and expanded
	throughout the brain in high motion datasets (e.g., children). Scrubbing
	of volumes with FD>0.2 effectively removed negative but not positive
	correlations; these findings suggest that positive relationships
	may reflect neural origins of motion while negative relationships
	are likely to originate from motion artifact. We also examined the
	ability of motion correction strategies to eliminate artifactual
	differences related to motion among individuals and between groups
	for a broad array of voxel-wise R-fMRI metrics. Residual relationships
	between motion and the examined R-fMRI metrics remained for all correction
	approaches, underscoring the need to covary motion effects at the
	group-level. Notably, global signal regression reduced relationships
	between motion and inter-individual differences in correlation-based
	R-fMRI metrics; Z-standardization (mean-centering and variance normalization)
	of subject-level maps for R-fMRI metrics prior to group-level analyses
	demonstrated similar advantages. Finally, our test-retest (TRT) analyses
	revealed significant motion effects on TRT reliability for R-fMRI
	metrics. Generally, motion compromised reliability of R-fMRI metrics,
	with the exception of those based on frequency characteristics -
	particularly, amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). The
	implications of our findings for decision-making regarding the assessment
	and correction of motion are discussed, as are insights into potential
	differences among volume-based metrics of motion.},

  abstract = {As researchers increase their efforts to characterize variations in
	the functional connectome across studies and individuals, concerns
	about the many sources of nuisance variation present and their impact
	on resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) measures continue to grow. Although
	substantial within-site variation can exist, efforts to aggregate
	data across multiple sites such as the 1000 Functional Connectomes
	Project (FCP) and International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative
	(INDI) datasets amplify these concerns. The present work draws upon
	standardization approaches commonly used in the microarray gene expression
	literature, and to a lesser extent recent imaging studies, and compares
	them with respect to their impact on relationships between common
	R-fMRI measures and nuisance variables (e.g., imaging site, motion),
	as well as phenotypic variables of interest (age, sex). Standardization
	approaches differed with regard to whether they were applied post-hoc
	vs. during pre-processing, and at the individual vs. group level;
	additionally they varied in whether they addressed additive effects
	vs. additive+multiplicative effects, and were parametric vs. non-parametric.
	While all standardization approaches were effective at reducing undesirable
	relationships with nuisance variables, post-hoc approaches were generally
	more effective than global signal regression (GSR). Across approaches,
	correction for additive effects (global mean) appeared to be more
	important than for multiplicative effects (global SD) for all R-fMRI
	measures, with the exception of amplitude of low frequency fluctuations
	(ALFF). Group-level post-hoc standardizations for mean-centering
	and variance-standardization were found to be advantageous in their
	ability to avoid the introduction of artifactual relationships with
	standardization parameters; though results between individual and
	group-level post-hoc approaches were highly similar overall. While
	post-hoc standardization procedures drastically increased test-retest
	(TRT) reliability for ALFF, modest reductions were observed for other
	measures after post-hoc standardizations-a phenomena likely attributable
	to the separation of voxel-wise from global differences among subjects
	(global mean and SD demonstrated moderate TRT reliability for these
	measures). Finally, the present work calls into question previous
	observations of increased anatomical specificity for GSR over mean
	centering, and draws attention to the near equivalence of global

	(3) reveal fundamental network properties, such as an imbalance of
	excitation (E) and inhibition (I). Here we delineate the spatiotemporal
	character of spontaneous synchrony in rat cortex slice cultures and
	a computational model over a range of different E-I conditions including
	disfacilitated (antagonized AMPA, NMDA receptors), unperturbed, and
	disinhibited (antagonized GABA(A) receptors). Local field potential
	was recorded with multielectrode arrays during spontaneous burst
	activity. Synchrony among neuronal groups was quantified based on
	phase-locking among recording sites. As network excitability was
	increased from low to high, we discovered three phenomena at an intermediate
	excitability level: (1) onset of synchrony, (2) maximized variability
	of synchrony, and (3) neuronal avalanches. Our computational model
	predicted that these three features occur when the network operates
	near a unique balanced E-I condition called "criticality." These
	results were invariant to changes in the measurement spatial extent,
	spatial resolution, and frequency bands. Our findings indicate that
	moderate average synchrony, which is required to avoid pathology,
	occurs over a limited range of E-I conditions and emerges together
	with maximally variable synchrony. If variable synchrony is detrimental
	to cortical function, this is a cost paid for moderate average synchrony.
	However, if variable synchrony is beneficial, then by operating near
	criticality the cortex may doubly benefit from moderate mean and
	maximized variability of synchrony.},

	connections would be 200. Control of Type I errors over all connections
	is therefore necessary. The network-based statistic (NBS) and spatial

	used to control family-wise errors when assessing the evidence for
	an experimental effect with mass univariate testing. The basic principle
	of the NBS and SPC is the same as supra-threshold voxel clustering.
	Unlike voxel clustering, where the definition of a voxel cluster
	is unambiguous, 'clusters' formed among supra-threshold connections
	can be defined in different ways. The NBS defines clusters using

  abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that brain networks derived from
	neuroimaging data have nontrivial topological features, such as small-world
	organization, modular structure and highly connected hubs. In these
	studies, the extent of connectivity between pairs of brain regions
	has often been measured using some form of statistical correlation.
	This article demonstrates that correlation as a measure of connectivity
	in and of itself gives rise to networks with non-random topological
	features. In particular, networks in which connectivity is measured
	using correlation are inherently more clustered than random networks,
	and as such are more likely to be small-world networks. Partial correlation
	as a measure of connectivity also gives rise to networks with non-random
	topological features. Partial correlation networks are inherently
	less clustered than random networks. Network measures in correlation
	networks should be benchmarked against null networks that respect
	the topological structure induced by correlation measurements. Prevalently
	used random rewiring algorithms do not yield appropriate null networks
	for some network measures. Null networks are proposed to explicitly
	normalize for the inherent topological structure found in correlation
	networks, resulting in more conservative estimates of small-world
	organization. A number of steps may be needed to normalize each network
	measure individually and control for distinct features (e.g. degree
	distribution). The main conclusion of this article is that correlation
	can and should be used to measure connectivity, however appropriate
	null networks should be used to benchmark network measures in correlation

  abstract = {Large-scale functional or structural brain connectivity can be modeled
	as a network, or graph. This paper presents a statistical approach
	to identify connections in such a graph that may be associated with
	a diagnostic status in case-control studies, changing psychological
	contexts in task-based studies, or correlations with various cognitive
	and behavioral measures. The new approach, called the network-based
	statistic (NBS), is a method to control the family-wise error rate
	(in the weak sense) when mass-univariate testing is performed at
	every connection comprising the graph. To potentially offer a substantial
	gain in power, the NBS exploits the extent to which the connections
	comprising the contrast or effect of interest are interconnected.
	The NBS is based on the principles underpinning traditional cluster-based
	thresholding of statistical parametric maps. The purpose of this
	paper is to: (i) introduce the NBS for the first time; (ii) evaluate
	its power with the use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
	curves; and, (iii) demonstrate its utility with application to a
	real case-control study involving a group of people with schizophrenia
	for which resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The NBS
	identified a expansive dysconnected subnetwork in the group with
	schizophrenia, primarily comprising fronto-temporal and occipito-temporal
	dysconnections, whereas a mass-univariate analysis controlled with
	the false discovery rate failed to identify a subnetwork.},

  abstract = {Whole-brain anatomical connectivity in living humans can be modeled
	as a network with diffusion-MRI and tractography. Network nodes are
	associated with distinct grey-matter regions, while white-matter
	fiber bundles serve as interconnecting network links. However, the
	lack of a gold standard for regional parcellation in brain MRI makes
	the definition of nodes arbitrary, meaning that network nodes are
	defined using templates employing either random or anatomical parcellation
	criteria. Consequently, the number of nodes included in networks
	studied by different authors has varied considerably, from less than
	100 up to more than 10(4). Here, we systematically and quantitatively
	assess the behavior, structure and topological attributes of whole-brain
	anatomical networks over a wide range of nodal scales, a variety
	of grey-matter parcellations as well as different diffusion-MRI acquisition
	protocols. We show that simple binary decisions about network organization,
	such as whether small-worldness or scale-freeness is evident, are
	unaffected by spatial scale, and that the estimates of various organizational
	parameters (e.g. small-worldness, clustering, path length, and efficiency)
	are consistent across different parcellation scales at the same resolution
	(i.e. the same number of nodes). However, these parameters vary considerably
	as a function of spatial scale; for example small-worldness exhibited
	a difference of 95\% between the widely-used automated anatomical
	labeling (AAL) template (approximately 100 nodes) and a 4000-node
	random parcellation (sigma(AAL)=1.9 vs. sigma(4000)=53.6+/-2.2).
	These findings indicate that any comparison of network parameters
	across studies must be made with reference to the spatial scale of
	the nodal parcellation.},

	subsets of neurons, one main excitatory subset, an auxiliary excitatory
	subset and an inhibitory subset. They are connected in one positive
	and one negative feedback loop, each containing linear dynamic and
	nonlinear static elements. The network also allows for a positive
	linear feedback loop. The behaviour of this network is studied for
	sinusoidal and white noise inputs. First steady state conditions
	are investigated and with this as starting point the linearized network
	is defined and conditions for stability is discovered. With white
	noise as input the stable network produces rhythmic activity whose
	spectral properties are investigated for various input levels. With
	a mean input of a certain level the network becomes unstable and
	the characteristics of these limit cycles are investigated in terms
	of occurence and amplitude. An electronic model has been built to
	study more closely the waveforms under both stable and unstable conditions.
	It is shown to produce signals that resemble EEG background activity
	and certain types of paroxysmal activity, in particular spikes.},

	pertaining to subgroup memberships, scanning sessions, and experimental
	tasks (stimuli), from which the design matrix is constructed. BSMac
	then performs parameter estimation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
	(MCMC) methods and generates plots for activation and FC, such as
	interactive 2D maps of voxel and region-level task-related changes
	in neural activity and animated 3D graphics of the FC results. The
